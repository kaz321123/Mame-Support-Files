10-Yard Fight (c) 1983 Irem.


Controlled with an 8-way joystick and two buttons.


- TRIVIA -


10-Yard Fight is the first slightly realistic American football game released.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hint 1: Don't pass if the line of the pass will take the ball anywhere near a free-running defender.


* Hint 2: At the kickoff, you should aim to get to at least the opponents' 40 yard line, if not further. Use your rear defenders on the run up the field!


* Hint 3: When making a play, look carefully at the your opponent's deployment. Are they all over the right hand side? Then wait till your runner is over the left, get the ball back to the quarterback and pass straight to the running back. Then leg it straight up the left hand side. When doing this, on either side, keep as close to the edge of the pitch as possible. If you're going to get tackled, quickly dodge off the field to end the play.


* Hint 4: You can also send the running back up the field, and run around with the quarterback until there's a pass available. In the arcade, I used to send the running back way up the right to the very top of the screen, and then run back and left with the quarterback as quickly as possible, doing a huge crossfield throw at the last second. The opponents would get sort of "caught in the scroll" as the ball when diagonally across and most times the running back would be away with no one anywhere near him.


* Hint 5: You can also run the quarterback straight through the pack - this is only sensible when you're at the 5 yard line or so.


* Hint 6: Down the ball as soon as you make 10 yards if you have any time left. This is because you can make 10 yards in 15 seconds and get 10 seconds back for a net loss of 5 seconds. It takes 30 seconds to make 20 yards and doing it in 1 play will get a net loss of 20 seconds (30 - 10), but doing it in 2 will only lose 10 seconds because you get 2 10 second bonuses (30 - 10 - 10). Once the clock runs out in mid-play just go as far as you can and hope it's enough to get more time.


* Hint 7: Learn the defense formations. Once you find the correct pass route for a particular formation it will work consistently.


* Hint 8: If you see a hard formation and you are short on time, your best move may be throwing an interception and hoping for an easier formation. This works best when you have 7 to 10 seconds left and don't think you can make ten yards or get downed before time runs out. Don't try it with less than 7 seconds though. 6:xx probably won't be enough time.


* Hint 9: Run to the right during "first contact" after the kickoff. There is an extra computer guy waiting on the left side. The best way to use the top blockers is to let the middle blocker connect, move straight right until the top right blocker connects, then head up again.


* Hint 10: You can do a forward pass after a lateral. This will cut through a few formations that are hard passing from the quarterback position. If you time it well a diagonal pass left (right running back to a left reciever) can miss an active middle defender.


* Hint 11: If you run the ball, use the reciever to block for you. The game doesn't have 'pass interference' calls so you have to be careful not to do this by accident.

1941 - Counter Attack (c) 02/1990 Capcom.


Controlled with an 8-way joystick and two buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the Capcom Play System hardware (CPS).


Here is all the official bosses names:

Stage 1 - Leviathan

Stage 2 - Bismarck

Stage 3 - V3Rocket

Stage 4 - Krote

Stage 5 - Leviathan

Stage 6 - Gotha


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (G.S.M. Capcom 3 - PCCB-00030) on 21/05/1990.


- UPDATES -


At the 5th position on the high score table, the Japanese version says 'j01' instead of 'o01'.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hint: Your airplane doesn't lose energy when it collides with cliffwalls, buildings etc. Instead it will rotate a bit after such collisions. That means you can tumble up and down these obstacles (keep on colliding), and if you keep shooting, your shots will go in all directions. This way you can clear up a lot of enemies when you are under pressure.

1942 (c) 12/1984 Capcom.


Controlled with an 8-way joystick and two buttons.


- TRIVIA -


1942 was the first game that Okamoto designed at Capcom.


Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Capcom Game Music - 28XA-94) on 25/08/1986.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hint 1: On certain levels, a V-formation of red planes will come straight down from the top. If you kill all 5 of them, and it turns into a Black/Red POW, pick it up - it's a free airplane!


* Hint 2: On levels where you pick up the extra two airplanes next to you: Use them to kill off the bigger planes. You will get a second chance to get them back later on.


* Hint 3: On the challenge levels, you can get large bonuses based upon shot accuracy...

90% - 94% = 10,000 pts.

95% - 99% = 20,000 pts.

100% = 10,000 pts

Oddly enough, the bonus for 100% accuracy is only 10,000 points, making it advantageous to let the last plane go by.


* Hint 4: On the levels with the huge boss plane, save all your loops! Shoot at it quickly, loop down to avoid the shots, and shoot at it again, and then loop. You should be able to kill it this way.


* Hint 5: Most of the time it is easier to keep only one wingman rather than both; that way it's easier to maneuver around enemies. If you miss the red airplanes that give you the wingman, kill off your man (assuming you have more) and the game will place you back before them.


* Hint 6: At times, a slow airplane will come out of the left or right hand side of the screen. Shoot it, and it will turn into a special figure. If you fly over the figure you will get 5,000 points!


* Here's an interesting bug in 1942: If you win an extra man by crossing the xxx points mark when killing the "boss" bomber, no extra planes will be awarded on the basis of points! Extra planes can still be obtained by getting the black-and-red POW, but no point-based bonuses will be awarded for the rest of the game.


* It is possible to finish the game. When completed, a screen appears with a message saying 'We give up!', and a 10,000,000 point bonus is awarded!!!

1943 - Midway Kaisen (c) 1987 Capcom.


It was 40 years ago, at the height of World War II. The Japanese main squadron tasted defeat off the coast of Midway Islands. Some say that this battle greatly changed the outcome of the war. Can you destroy the battleship, 'Yamato' ? Relive the excitement of "1942" by controlling your P-38 equipped with six secret weapons. In addition to the now famous loop, you have at your command, lighting, cyclone, and tsunami to ward off your enemies.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and two buttons.


- TRIVIA -


The subtitle of this game translates from Japanese as Midway Naval Battle.


This game is known outside Japan as "1943 - The Battle of Midway".


This game runs on the "Commando (capcom)" hardware.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Choose Your Weapon: Hold these buttons at the beginning of each stage to activate the weapon... 

Stage 1 for a Small Shot Gun, press 1P side Down and 2P side A. 

Stage 2 for a Big Shot Gun, press 1P side A and 2P side B. 

Stage 3 for a Laser, press 1P side Upright+A+B and 2P side Down+B. 

Stage 4 for a Big Shot Gun, press 1P side Downleft+B and 2P side Leftup. 

Stage 5 for a 3-way, press 1P side A and 2P side Up. 

Stage 6 for a Auto, press 1P side Left and 2P side Right+B. 

Stage 7 for a Shell, press 1P side Upleft and 2P side Down. 

Stage 8 for a 3-way, press 1P side Left+A+B and 2P side A+B. 

Stage 9 for a Laser, press 1P side Downright+A+B and 2P side Downright+A+B. 

Stage 10 for a Shell, press 1P side Upright+B and 2P side Downright. 

Stage 11 for a Auto, press 1P side Upleft and 2P Right+A. 

Stage 12 for a 3-way, press 1P side Right+A+B and 2P side Upright+A+B. 

Stage 13 for a Auto, press 1P side Up and 2P side Down. 

Stage 14 for a Laser, press 1P side Upleft+A+B and 2P side Right+A+B. 

Stage 15 for a Shell, press 1P side Downright+A and 2P side Downleft+A. 

Stage 16 for a Auto, press 1P side Right+A and 2P side Upright+A. 


* Full Ammunition Load: A little known trick in the game is to hold down the fire button at the very end of a board immediately after beating the boss. By holding down the button until the plane takes off in the subsequent board, the game gives you a full ammunition load (65 Seconds)! This trick only works every third board or so and it may even change your selected weapon. 


* Hint 1: The '100% accuracy' bonus refers NOT to how many planes you down during the round, but rather how many of the guns on the enemy aircraft carriers you get. For this reason, it's best to ignore the planes and concentrate on the ships - that's where the big points are. 


* Hint 2: It's possible to shoot one of the ships just before your plane dives in to battle the fleet, and that you can capture the flames that erupt from it. This gives a 10,000 point bonus. 


* Hint 3: At some points in the background there are 'shootable' patches which will yield a bonus when shot enough. They can be recognized by the sparks which will occur when your bullets hit them. One such bonus is on level one: it is on the lowest part of the second cloud bank to the left after the last large plane of the level appears. It appears as a cow. There is also another shootable area which appears after the first ship in the first level, in the water above it. 

1) The cow bonus is worth 20,000 points, and on the first level, it's followed by a strange object that looks like a dragonfly moving right to left across the screen. Shooting the dragonfly yields an additional 10,000 point bonus. 

2) The cow and dragonfly bonuses also appear on other rounds; the cow can sometimes be seen on the deck of a carrier! 

3) There's a bonus shaped like a spinning cat (!). When collected, it upgrades your weapon to a laser. 


* Hint 4: The 'star' bonus gives you 5,000 points when caught. It may also increase the capacity of your fuel gauge by eight units (mine went from 64 to 72 units). The white star also gives you the max seconds of weapon (if you get it with no weapon, the next time you get one you'll get 64 seconds instead of 20). 


* Hint 5 (This has been reported on level 2, but may exist on other levels as well): Sometimes an astronaut will emerge from the side of the final (boss) ship and walk off the screen. Shoot it for 100,000 points! This happens most often when the command tower is shot repeatedly before the ship is destroyed. 


* Hint 6: If you get the "propeller" power-up (it looks like a propeller over a circle), your energy level will be fully replenished. 


* Hint 7: Still another bonus is shaped like an pine cone or acorn. When you fly over a certain spot, the pine cone shows up and is worth 2,000 points. 


* Hint 8: When the boss ship explodes, the control center breaks into 4 pieces. The pieces are worth 10,000 points each if shot. 


* Hint 9: If you shoot a POW enough to cycle it through about 4 or 5 times, it will turn into a fueltank :) that helps a GREAT deal on the last few stages, especially a stage or 2 where they DONT give you a full tank at the end of the cloud stage before you go to the water!

This game is an official licensed product of the NHLPA (National Hockey League Players Association). It features the voice of the legendary NHL announcer Pat Foley. Over 100 real players, each player's skill level reflects his real NHL ability.

The flyer of this game has a photograph of former Chicago Blackhawk goaltender Eddie 'The Eagle' Belfour on it (now with the Toronto Maple Leafs). The text refers to a '140mph' slapshot -- The individual who wrote this seems to have forgotten to do the metric conversion from kilometres per hour. He/she should have written 140 km/h (or 90 mph) as that's more realistic.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hint 1: In the ramp park, a good trick is to constantly push the kick button and do skid-outs at the top of each side of the half-pipe. To do this, get to the lip of the ramp, hold the stick parallel with the lip, and stop pressing kick. This will cause you to grind and skid down the ramp. You will be awarded big points at the lip and at the base of the ramp. This procedure may be repeated over and over for some incredible (effortless) high scores.


* Hint 2: Don't forget to visit the skate shops. Do not underestimate what a new board and shoes does for you. Buying new equipment allows you to move faster, jump farther, recover faster, and pull off more tricks.


* Hint 3: In the ramp section, levels 8, 9, and 10: holding down the kick and jump buttons simultanously on the lip of the ramp will boost your air. This trick only works when you're going the correct speed (usually your third or fourth jump), and only once (as far as I can tell) per ramp session per level.


* Hint 4: The entire game should focus around the Sessions skate park (the blue park in the right quadrant of the playfield). Making multiple passes through this park will greatly increase your scores. Remember to keep jumping and spinning. A good game should leave you feeling completely exhausted!

The Japanese version of Aliens is very unlike any other version to appear in other countries.


* Deletions:

Most obviously, both APC driving levels have been entirely deleted.

As such, the subplot of rescuing Newt is gone.

Therefore, Newt never appears in stage 1.

When you take on the 'Shrinky-Dink Alien Quartet', the first one fully enlarged hops off-screen, leaving you to only battle the other three.

Many of the aliens, zombies and mid-bosses can be killed with fewer shots.


* Additions:

Two new kinds of minor enemy appear in the game:

a. An adult alien bursts out of the background wall during the vent portion of what we consider Stage 5.

b. The small form of the Shrinky-Dink Alien, as seen in the form of the second mid-boss in Stage 5, reappears in Stage 7.

Titles have been given to each level.

Special weapons and bombs appear much more frequently in the game.

It is now possible to attain 1-ups in the game.

In addition to the other enemies in this section, ground-popping aliens now appear earlier, in stage 3.

In addition to the other enemies, flying aliens now appear during the first power loader segment, in stage 3.

Flying aliens are much more frequent throughout the outdoor portion of stage 5 and 7.

Extra exploding barrels appear thoughout the game.


* Other changes:

Adult Aliens are now purple instead of maroon, face-huggers are now flesh-toned instead of green, ect.

Many of the adult aliens in the elevator sequence of stage 3 have been removed.

They have been replaced with flying aliens that do not damage the cables.

This make this sequence much easier.

The beams from the 3-way gun have changed color from purple to orange.

During the final battle, the queen does not breathe fire/acid at you.

Instead, after flashing white, she send out multiple images of herself as a projectile!

The queen charges at you constantly even if you are in the power loader.

This make the final battle much more difficult.

- TRIVIA -


This was the second prototype of "Major Havoc", the first was called "Tollian's Web".


- UPDATES -


Differences with the final game:

* There is no music in Alpha One.

* The story of the Vaxxian is much different. Notice the Catastro-fighter has a different name, as does the vaxxian home planet.

* There isn't any enemy scoring on the 'story' screen.

* Many of the sounds are different. These include the player firing sound and the enemy explosions. The sound of Rex 'frying' is missing.

* Some graphics are different, such as the Space station explosions.

* Many other small differences and the overall unfinished feel of the game.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Warp Codes: It's possible to warp to higher levels in Alpha One from the start of the game by using certain codes. This is useful to not only be able to get through the game more quickly, but each warp also gives a fairly hefty bonus for carrying it out. This is done by playing the 'mini-Breakout' game at the bottom right-hand corner of the screen when the game starts. The game will have a phrase such as, 'Enter Red Warp 00' at the bottom of the screen. What you do is use the controls to 'dial in' the first digit of the appropriate code given below, then press fire to serve the ball and repeat as necessary. The codes are:

Red code - 23, 250,000 pts, Level 4.

Yellow code - 46, 600,000 pts, Level 8.

Green code - 51, 700,000 pts, Level 9.


Note that you can only enter the codes in the order they're given - it's not possible to enter, say, the red warp code followed directly by the green warp code.

* Here's A Way To Get Ridiculously High Scores In Alpine Ski: Go thru the downhill section with the points flags very slowly and avoid collecting positive points:

1) There's some point in the course (should be easy to find) where there's a negative points flag near trees that can be crashed into. This trick is best done here.

2) Collect negative points to roll your score back under zero. You will be granted massive time on the massive points you have. Unfortunately, time will be taken off at an incredible rate.

3) Run over the negative points flag as necessary to get rid of the points you win just by moving forward and crashing into the nearby trees.

4) Repeat Step 4 until you've run out of time. You now have a completely unbeatable high-score which (if it were 1981) people would beg you to tell them how you did it.

WARNING: ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY DON'T GO BACK ACROSS ZERO OR YOUR GAME WILL END IMMEDIATELY!!!

Area 51 (c) 10/1995 Atari Games.

Game ID: 136105


- TRIVIA -


Developed by Mesa Logic for Atari (although also licensed as a Time Warner product in certain territories), Area 51 was the first game for the Cojag hardware. The 'Cojag' represents Coin-Operated Jaguar, as in the Atari console. The Jaguar hardware was adapted for use in an arcade setting, with a slightly modified board to bring it in line with the standard Atari arcade system. Since the hardware could process very large amounts of data, it was considered far cheaper to store this on an IDE hard drive, connected to the main board. The hard drive was the key to the game play's movie capability. There's about 23 minutes of video on the 1 GB hard drive. The Cojag system can support 16Bit video streams. The original Area 51 uses 1 15 Bit stream for the main video, and an additional 1 Bit stream for the Kronn Hunter palette corruption. Apparently Atari wanted the sprites in Kronn Hunter mode to change colour as the chance of them killing you increased, but this idea was abandoned. It did, however, resurface in some of the home versions. 


Another interesting fact is that the software designer had the option of using either a 68010 or a MIPS R3000 as the primary CPU - making the Cojag the first 2 in 1 hardware option, although it was more of a hotswappable system than two processors in one. Indeed, later production runs of Area 51 used the R3000, for greater compatibility with "Maximum Force", the followup game.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Kronn Hunter Mode: At the beginning of the game, shoot the first three STAAR team members you see with the first three bullets (don't reload or miss). If you did this right you'll enter Kronn Hunter mode. In this mode, you are a mercenary from the Kronn hierarchy sent to steralize Area 51 of the Kronn rebels. You will notice that the grenades, bullets, shotgun shells and machine gun bullets have all taken on a Kronn form.


* Egg Cellent: On the forklift ride shoot all the barrels before and after the ride. There will be a partially hidden barrel you will have to shoot to the left of the forklift. This will lead you to 'egg cellent' where you shoot eggs and baby aliens.


* Chow Palace: After your first progress report in Area 51, where it tells you your percentage and things like that, you will see a wall lined with windows. Shoot all the windows across the entire wall and you will be in the power up room, where you can see aliens attacking women and power-ups all over the screen.


* Secret Area Before Final Boss: Right before you fight the Final Boss when you are outside, you will go to an area with zombies throwing barrels. Shoot all the barrels that are not thrown and you will go to a secret area filled with power ups.


* Head Quarters: To see the alien restroom, you must shoot three blue lights that appear in the corners of the screen. At the beginning of the game, when you enter the building, shoot the first blue light in the upper left-hand corner of the screen. At the conclusion of level 1, while the screen is spinning, shoot the remaining two blue lights in the upper right-hand corner of the screen.


* Secret Level: In the office building, you will go into a series of 2 or 3 doors with nameplates on all of them, shoot them all and then you will go into a secret room with power ups and an alien girl at the bottom.


* X Marks The Spot: On the helicopter ride, shoot all of the boxes with flames on them. If done correctly, you will be sent into 'X Marks The Spot', which is a room where you keep breaking the glass on a wall with your guns to reveal a picture of a female policeperson lying there in a very inviting position.

Ares No Tsubasa - The Legendary Soldiers (c) 11/1986 Capcom.


Controlled with an 8-way joystick and two buttons.

Ares no Tsubasa translates from Japanese as 'Wings of Ares'. Ares is the Greek god of war.


This game is known in US as "Legendary Wings".

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* On each level, a trio of statues arranged in a triangular pattern will appear about three-quarters of the way through. Bomb them until one of them reveals a passageway (you'll have to bomb them all; it's not the same one every time), and fly into it. You'll now be in a cave, free to fly along and collect treasure chests worth 200 points apiece. When you're in the cave, though, don't shoot - if you fire and hit a treasure chest it's destroyed, and some of the cavern walls release enemies when shot.

- TIPS & TRICKS -


* Hint 1: The power pills are not quite random. There are essentially two types of games. One has lots of light blue multi-ball pills and the pink warp pills - this is a low scoring game. The high scoring game gives you more of the other pills.


* Hint 2: On each level, the ball will not speed up completely until it hits the back wall, so:

1) Try to remove bricks from the bottom up, or punch a hole through thicker areas of bricks rather than go straight through (e.g. take out the left side of level 2 rather than the single block at the right as you will catch far more pills).

2) If you have collected a lot of S pills and the ball has been in play for a bit of time, be prepared for a sudden speedup.


* Hint 3: Also, the D token speeds up the balls and is pretty useless on most levels (the one with the enclosed diamond is the only good example I can think of).


* Hint 4: As only one pill can fall at a time, multiple balls can reduce your potential score quite drastically. Every pill is worth 1000 points. For the first few levels, get every pill you can, but do not use the special powers. You will get a lot of extra ships and should get a gray P (extra vaus) or two - thereby starting early with 6 or 7 ships.


* Hint 5: In the mask end game, you should get 15 hits (1000pts per hit) on the mask/per man until you eliminate the mask with the 16th hit on your last man to end the game.

Art of Fighting (c) 09/1992 SNK.

Game ID: 0044


An early Neo-Geo martial arts fighter with two selectable characters in one player mode and eight selectable characters in two player mode which also features a long-nosed end boss. Progressive damage is shown on each fighter's face for a dramatic effect.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and four buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game is known in Japan as "Ryuuko no Ken" (translates from Japanese as 'Dragon and Tiger Fist').


This game runs on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware.


A bootleg of this game is known as "Fit of Fighting".


This is the first fighting game to feature the 'camera zoom' - where the camera zooms in when the fighters are close together and zooms out when the fighters move away from each other. This is also the first fighting game to utilize a 'spirit meter'. Every time a special move is executed the spirit meter is depleted accordingly. The more powerful the special move, the more it depletes. When it's empty special moves can't be done anymore, however, you can recharge the spirit meter by standing still and holding the A or B button leaving you totally defenseless.


The Haou Shokou Ken was referred to as the Haou Ken (or as the game put it, the 'Haow-Ken'). Its similarity to Ryu's (of "Street Fighter" fame) Hadou Ken forced the name change.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Move Command Delay: Its posible to input the commands for any special or super move but it is not necessary to press the corresponding attack button right away, this allows you to delay any move for as long as you want in order to surprise an opponent! This trick also enables you to perform slower versions of some special moves such as proyectile attacks. Try it! :)

Geese Howard's guest appearance (see 'Tips And Tricks' section) tries to tie this game's story with the Fatal Fury games. Apparently, this game takes place a few years before the events ocurred in "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" since Geese looks quite young and uses a very different fighting style (instead of his trademark Aikido which he learned in Japan). Another fact is the special ending when you defeat Geese (you get to see when he gives the order to eliminate Jeff Bogard who happens to be Terry & Andy Bogard's father, before he heads to Japan to learn that country's martial art techniques). This fact also explains why Ryo Sakazaki is so damn powerful in his "Fatal Fury Special" appearance (after all, he was already a powerful & skilled fighter and has had more time than most of the Fatal Fury characters to brush up on his techniques!). Obviously, all these storyline details were ignored in the King of Fighters series for the sake of convenience (All the "Art of Fighting" characters should be way older than the Fatal Fury characters in that game!).


In Temjin's ending, Terry Bogard makes a guest appearance as a little boy!


- UPDATES -


The Japanese version features different voice actors for some characters (John Crawley, Robert Garcia & King).


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


Adjust the game difficulty setting up to level 8 in order to boost game's overall speed!


It may be downright cheap & silly, but if you successfully manage to throw an opponent and then hit him with a special move as he gets up, you will dizzy your opponent! This can be done over and over again with most characters... :/


Beat opponents with a special move at the end of the decisive round to see a special 'defeat' animation (some auto-combos & special moves that lift the opponent of the ground won't work though).


Defeat all opponents in two rounds only to fight a special battle against Fatal Fury's main villain & owner of Southtown: Geese Howard (Notice that it is possible to use continues & use different characters as long as you defeat your opponents in 'two rounds only'!). :)

Asteroids (c) 11/1979 Atari.

Game ID: 035127-035145


- TRIVIA -


An Italian bootleg released by Sidam is known as "Asterock".


Asteroids, completed at the end of 1979, was a much celebrated arcade game that captured the imaginations of millions of players, while capturing a good many quarters as well.


Originally called 'Cosmos', the original design was a copy of "Space Wars", except with asteroids littering the playfield as an aesthetic effect. Actually, 'Cosmos' was once known as 'Planet Grab', in which you had to claim a planet by touching it. 'Planet Grab' simply required you to claim planets by touching them with your spaceship. 'Cosmos' allowed you to blow up the planets and duel with another ship, "Space Wars"-style. Only in Asteroids, which came along two years later, did Atari engineer LYLE RAINS introduce the concept of floating rocks.


The first 200 Asteroids machines were actually "Lunar Landers". Atari was so hot on Asteroids that it cut short the production run on "Lunar Lander" and released the 200 complete with "Lunar Lander" cabinet art.


Atari's bestselling coin-op game of all time. Approximately 56,565 units were produced (47,840 upright and 8,725 cocktail).


* Remembrances from the Video Game Masters: Working on Asteroids was so intense that Lyle Rains and Ed Logg often dreamt about their work. Lyle Rains: "In the course of my work I have always found that there are times during the development process when the project gets to me in such a way that I'm eating, drinking, sleeping, and breathing the project. When I close my eyes the images of the screen are there and I dream about them at night. There is something just very intense when you live with a project like that day and night, for months at a time. When we were working on Asteroids, I would play Asteroids for a number of hours in the evening, then I'd go home and I'd close my eyes, and as I was drifting off to sleep I'd see the asteroids floating around the screen. "Ed Logg: "I was shooting the asteroids all night long.... I'd just play the game over and over and over in my head, just as if you were playing it in real life. To a certain extent, I play a lot of the games in my mind long before I ever write them because you have to get all the interactions down pat before you can start programming. I know what it's going to look like before I even get there.".


* Popular from the Start: A good barometer of a game's future success was how popular it was within the labs at Atari. The software developers often had to chase people away from their prototype machines when they arrived at their desks in the morning or returned from lunch. Lyle Rains: "The development on the really good games gets bogged down, because people want to . . . play them all the time. I was in the lab quite often playing Asteroids, as were many other people.". On the overall popularity of Asteroids, Steve Calfee said: "A lot of people really liked it. Somehow there's something about people, they like to clean spaces. With Asteroids it's easy to measure your accomplishment, you're breaking big rocks into little rocks and then the little rocks into nothing. It's sort of a metaphor for life. "Rich Adam recalled his own first encounter with Asteroids: "I'll never forget going into the lab and seeing that game for the first time. It was like an adrenaline rush. . . I'm out flying this spaceship and it's the miraculous escape.  I've got this situation where I've got tons of these boulders flying around the screen, I have almost nowhere to go. I get to blast my way out of it and cheat death one more time.... That's a good fantasy... You've got all these things flying around and yet you're able to survive."


Howard Delman described what it was like creating the sounds for Asteroids: "In those days there were no all-purpose sound chips like we have now, so I had to create a hardware circuit for each sound. I would string together electrical circuits that would produce an output wave-form that corresponded to the wave-form of the sound. When put through an amplifier and a loud-speaker, it would sound like whatever I was trying to create. . .The boom-boom-boom background sound was sort of meant to be like a heartbeat, and the idea was that as the game progressed, the sound sped up, and the player's heart would speed up, too. You know, stress!".


* The Great 25-Cent Escape: On the intensity of playing Asteroids, Ed Rotberg recalled: "Asteroids was just so intense in the fact that you had a concept of all around fantasy. You had to keep your eyes constantly in motion around the screen because the danger could be coming from any direction, at anytime, and it was always so imminent. In Asteroids it was just you out there, trying to survive. It's an incredibly intense game. The tuning in terms of how fast the spaceship turns and how fast the bullets move and how far they go and how fast the asteroids can go, just all the tuning that Ed Logg put into that, is real artistry. Asteroids is a video game artistic masterpiece."The simple fact that the spaceship in Asteroids continues to move after you cut thrust, providing a wee glimpse of the Newtonian mechanics of actual space flight, triggered the imaginations of many users. Rich Adam said: "Asteroids fulfilled the fantasy of being out in space, with no gravity, and free floating. The spaceship had a very elegant grace. A lot of motion in the game had grace, even the way the boulders floated around."And the epic quality of the game was noted by Ed Rotberg: "What Asteroids allows players to do is to put themselves in an incredible predicament, and then extricate themselves from it. You feel like a hero coming out of it.".


There was a modified version of Asteroids that was given the nick-name "Turtleroids", it was part of a long series of practical jokes against the vice-president of marketing for Atari that was sick of a game concept called 'Turtle Races'. One day Ed switched the PROMs of the golden edition of Asteroids in the lobby of Atari so that the little and big UFOs were replaced by turtles, thus providing them with a constant reminder. Another practical joke involving Asteroids was a slight modification in the prototype of the game, because Owen Rubin (initials ORR on most Atari high score tables) kept filling up the high score tables when the programmers were not around. So, they modified the program to replace Owen's initials with Ed's own to keep him away.


In a monumental display of overconfidence on the part of the Atari programmers, Asteroids rolls over at only 99,999 points. Several players during days-long marathon games have scored over 100,000,000...


Asteroids keeps track of up to 255 extra men. If you have too many, the game may slow down, probably due to the processor having to draw all the extra men on the screen.


Asteroids inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Hyperspace' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album.


An Asteroids unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', in the 1983 movie 'Terms of Endearment', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1984 movie 'Night of the Comet', and the 1985 movie 'Remo Williams - The Adventure Begins' and in the 1983 movie 'The Adventures of Bob & Doug McKenzie - Strange Brew'.


- UPDATES -


The Rev. 2 version says '1979 Atari' at the bottom of the title screen, instead of 'Asteroids by Atari'. Also, the 'invulnerability glitch' is corrected (see 'Tips And Tricks' section for more info).


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Rev. 1 Tricks: The original software version had an invulnerability glitch, where you could hide in the upper corners (in the score) and nothing would hit you. Also, you can get your ship to fly backwards- thrust in one direction until reaching full speed, and then quickly turn around 180 degrees and continue thrusting.


* Classic Strategy: The classic strategy for Asteroids high scores involves saving one or two slow-moving (and highly vertical) rocks, and then waiting in a corner of the screen while killing the 1000-point small saucers with wrap-around shots.

To employ this strategy: sit about one inch from the left (or right) edge of the screen, and about three inches from the top (or bottom). If the saucer appears close to you, quickly turn and hit it with a quick burst before it can move. If you can't get it, QUICKLY move to the opposite side of the screen, aim toward the screen's edge, and kill it with the wrap-around shots. This becomes quite easy with practice. ALWAYS stay on the opposite edge of the screen from the little saucer after it starts firing! This strategy depends on the fact that the little saucer in Asteroids is incapable of aiming and firing wrap-around shots at the player. This is NOT! true, however, in "Asteroids Deluxe"...

This game was created out of modified "Asteroids" code. At the same time this game was being produced, "Space Duel" was in the works, but was shelved as Asteroids Deluxe was green-lighted for production. This game did poorly and Atari later released "Space Duel" to moderate success.


Approximately 22,300 units were produced.


An Asteroids Deluxe unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Tron', in the 1982 movie 'The Thing' and in the 1984 movie 'Night of the Comet'.


In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including: "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hint 1: When the Killsat ('snowflake') ship comes out near the end of the level, DO NOT attack it head-on. Shoot at it, turn around, get further away, and then turn back towards it and keep firing. This way you are moving backwards, but you keep firing at it.


* Hint 2: Your shields have a maximum life expectancy of 17 seconds. Each collision with a rock takes away about 6 seconds of shield time. Once your shield runs down, it can not be recharged. In other words: use your shields as little as possible.


* Hint 3: In the original "Asteroids", the large UFO shot in a random direction. In Deluxe, it shoots at rocks 75 percent of the time and in the general direction of your ship 25 percent of the time. If no rocks are nearby, all shots go towards your ship. This renders the 'save and hunt' strategy from original "Asteroids" useless. Also, the small UFO can now shoot aimed wrap-around shots, and at the 60,000 point mark, both UFOs shoot with greatly improved accuracy.


* Hint 4: As the Killsat pieces chase you about (after the snowflake is broken apart of course), you may use this to your advantage - if you maneuver so that the pieces are between you and an attacking UFO, this makes an effective shield, without having to waste your shields on the annoyingly accurate UFO shots. Unfortunately, you don't get the points for this, and similarly the pieces shield the UFO from you as well. I find this tactic primarily useful when you still have lots of rocks left, and don't have the maneuvering room to deal with the pesky UFO.

The second programmer hired by Tim Skelly, Rob Patton, was only 17 when he joined Cinematronics. This game is very reminiscent of the old Mattel hand-held football games from the late 70's. The gameplay is not as deep, though :o). Vectorbeam didn't have a game to ship after "Speed Freak" and needed a product to sell so Cinematronics sold them "Barrier" and in the words of Tim Skelly, 'laughed our asses off about it'.

Game ID: TP-030


- TRIVIA -


The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Distinguished'.


Licensed to Taito for world distribution and to Unite Trading for Korea.


This is the last shoot-'em-up and the first 'non-endless' game by Toaplan. A special version of Batsugun existed, originally it was only for the AOU show (an arcade game show held in Japan every year) and not for sale. After the Toaplan bankruptcy, the board started to appear on the second hand market.


- UPDATES -


In the special version:

* Differents colours for all stages.

* Some sprites have different colors.

* The title screen/demo & the ship selection screen have different colors.

* The 4-lap end is different.

* The power-ups are different.

* The collision detection area is tighter than the original.

* The smart-bombs are bigger and nicer looking. They also do more dammage.

* You get 8 credits instead of 4 to complete the game.

So basically the "Special ver." is an easier version.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hidden Functions: If the 'Invulnerability dip switch' is enabled, you are invulnerable but you may also 'Pause' the game with P2 Start and restart with P1 Start.

Battle Zone (c) 11/1980 Atari.

Game ID: 0364xx


- TRIVIA -


Battle Zone went into the arcades in 1980 and created such a sensation that the U.S. army ordered modified versions of the games to use in training.


Battle Zone was the first environmental 3-D landscape game. The game used a system of bit-slice processors called a 'mathbox' to do 3-D calculations for the display. This kind of 'squeezing the most out of minimal hardware' mindset was what led Atari to create the innovative games it did in the 1980's. Approximately 15,020 units were produced.


As Battle Zone was so innovative for its time, the US Army commissioned Atari to create a version of the game for infantry vehicle training. Ed Rotberg was assigned the project, but was very opposed to it. Major Dave Robinson and General Donn Starry of the U.S. Army were responsible for bringing Atari the idea of making a military version to be used in training.


* The Creation of Battle Zone: The idea of a tank simulator was championed by Morgan Hoff, who became the project leader for Battle Zone, while Ed Rotberg was the principal programmer. Ed Rotberg: "Morgan Hoff more or less championed it and decided to put together a team to implement the game. Given the technology that we had, the real challenge was how to make the game appear as if we had more technology than we did. And the question was always: How do we involve the player? Meeting those needs was where the artistry was involved in designing a game in those days.".

The developers used brilliant software code and innovative circuitry to create a high tech look. But some low-technology tricks were used as well. For example, a simple band of red cellophane was applied to the inside of the Battle Zone screen. Placed across the top of the screen, the result was red colors for the radar and warning messages, even though Battlezone didn't have a two-color display. A game takes on a life of its own, Rotberg said: "Most games rarely turn out exactly the way that you plan them. Every time that you play the game, you try to amplify those things that are fun, and you try to pare away those things that are annoying and really not enjoyable. It is kind of like a story that grows in the telling.".


The volcano erupting in the background was created by Owen Rubin (Major Havoc). Rubin pestered Rotberg to add the volcano but he was too busy to write the code and told Rubin that if he wanted the erupting volcano he'd have to write the code. The next morning, Rotberg walked in to a volcano erupting onscreen and the code listing on his desk.


* Remembrances from the Video Game Masters: On the erupting volcano in the background of Battle Zone, Ed Rotberg said: "One of the other programmers who was working on another project in the same lab kept saying, 'Why don't you make the volcano active?' I had enough to do just to make the game play. And everyday he would say 'You know, you really need to make that volcano active.' He is really currently one of my very best friends, and he is a wonderful guy. But he kept pestering me about this. One day I said, 'You're a programmer. If you want the volcano active, you write the code and I'll put it in.' So I came in the next day and there was this chunk of code on my desk describing the motion of the rocks and such. I took an afternoon off and put the code into the program. That's how the volcano became active. It was never in the design.".


Atari engineers were always amazed by the abilities of the players out in the arcades. Morgan Hoff: "I remember a game that contained a succession of increasingly difficult mazes ranging from easy to difficult, to those requiring super human skill in timing. I was completely surprised to find players who could complete the most difficult levels. They were in a world of their own. They played the game with incredibly accurate hand and eye coordination and memory. One day I was in an arcade and. . . the best player was seven. He was extraordinary and he was standing on a chair to reach the controls."


Although Atari engineers uniformly praised the best players out in the arcades, many of the engineers were awesome players themselves. Once two Atari engineers went on a skiing vacation in Utah and Dan Pliskin came back with the following story: "We were at Snowbird, and we had only been there a few days when we started to miss video games. So, we found a little arcade and my friend got onto a Missile Command (which was a pretty old game by then) and I got onto some pinball machine. We broke the high-score tables, and he had, like, 200 free cities and I had, like, 60 free games. When we got tired of playing, we just left them to these kids that were just wide-eyed, staring at us. The kids were standing there with their mouths open. They had never seen pinball wizards and video game masters.".


* Popular from the Start As Battle Zone took shape, engineers in the lab wanted to play it, a lot. Ed Rotberg: "Usually when you have a winner you leave your lab for awhile and when you return there are people standing around playing your game, and that happens over and over again. You end up having to kick them off your machine to get any work done. That is your first indication that you have a winner. And I have never seen a really strong game that did not have that appeal. The guys in the labs are pretty good barometers." Another barometer, though after the fact, was to go into the arcades to watch others playing it. Rotberg continued:"The best feeling for a game designer is to go out into an arcade and see people having fun playing the game that they created. There is nothing better than that. To walk around and see all the other games, and know that people can choose from anything in there, but they are playing your game. That is pretty heavy stuff."


A Battle Zone unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Tron', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1984 movie 'The Philadelphia Experiment' and in the 1986 movie 'Running Scared' (the cab appears in Billy Crystal's apartment).


In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins inluding: "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* General Tank Strategy:

1) Enemy tanks have the same firing limitation that you do - the shot has to disappear out of range or hit something before they can fire again. This is the key - keep them missing and nail them before they can reload. Never sit still.

2) You have to get the enemy tank in front of you. Turn (in place) in the direction of the tank until you hear it shoot at you. As soon as you hear the shot, back straight up until you see the shot pass. Repeat this until the tank is visible. If the tank is close to you, its best to just back up without turning, until it's in your cone of vision. It won't be able to zero in on you if you keep moving.

3) If you hit a barricade while backing up, you have to react quickly to avoid getting shot. Move forward, then turn slightly and then keep backing up. If you're near the pyramid next to the short cube, you may get hung up between them. It's a good idea to know where they are and avoid them.

4) Once the tank is in front of you, if it's not facing you, just zero in on it and blow it away. If it is facing you (and coming at you) you may be able to get a barricade in-between it and you. If you can, the tank will run into it, then turn to avoid it. You can then nail it once it moves away from the barricade.

5) If you can't get a shot at a tank's side, check the next sections for tips on killing it head-on.


* Regular Tanks:

1) Drive towards it at an angle (never directly head-on). It won't be able to zero in on you. You may have to keep adjusting your course slightly as you go. Drive even with or slightly past it, pause a second, then back up a little, turn towards it and fire.

2) What happens is: as you pass the tank, it will turn towards you to track you, but you're moving faster than it can. When you back up again, it will still be facing where you were. It will usually fire at you and miss, giving you plenty of time to aim.


* Supertanks: Follow the same directions as for killing regular tanks, except don't pause when you pull side-by-side with it - immediately back up, turn and kill it. You may actually bump into the tank, but that's fine. It will shoot at you and miss (as long as you keep moving), giving you time to blow it away. Once you master the timing of this, tanks are a breeze.


* Missiles:

1) Missiles are tricky to get the hang of. The first one comes at you straight, so you can just back up in a straight line to kill it. The second group will straighten out near the end of their attack so you can do the same to them, although youll need a lot of room to back up. For the rest of the missiles, you have to get the hang of anticipating their flight pattern.

2) As soon as you hear the missile coming, start backing up and aim your tank so the missile will come down just to the left of the center of the screen (use the crosshairs as a guide). Keep backing up. The missile will zig-zag on the way to the ground, then go straight, go slightly to your left, then turn sharply right. Watch for that straight part of its flight, wait for the left turn, then when it turns to the right - fire. The missile will fly right into your shot. If you position your tank correctly when the missile comes down, you don't need to do any turning while youre backing up. (You can also use this method for the second group of missiles, except you have to nail them early, before their flight pattern straightens out.)

3) If you miss, you may be able to dodge the missile by moving ahead and to the right, or if you started backing up soon enough, you may get off a second shot (it will repeat the straight-left-right pattern if given enough room).

4) This takes a bit of practice, but once you get into the rhythm, you can kill off missiles to your heart's content. Just watch out for barriers!


* Saucers: Don't go after saucers unless you know exactly where the enemy tank is, and can do so safely. If the enemy tank gets behind you, then don't chase a saucer down - the tank will shoot you in the back. During a missile attack, don't worry about the saucers at all. They'll just distract you.


* Miscellaneous: One of the cool tricks for Battlezone is trapping missiles. This can come in handy for hunting for saucers, or if you need to take a break. You need to get behind a tall barricade (the ones shaped like a refrigerator work best). When a missile attacks, get right up to the barricade. You need to position yourself so the saucer will jump up over the barricade (and you), as straight-on as possible. As soon as it's overhead, spin the tank in place to the right (clockwise). If you time it right, the missile won't be able to exit the radar screen and will be stuck behind you as long as you keep spinning. Now you can just keep spinning until a saucer happens by. If you stop turning to shoot it, the missile will escape, so try to shoot it on the fly. Eventually the missile will escape on its own, although you can delay it by backing up a little while spinning to keep it in range. In order to take a break while trapping a missile, you have to find a way to keep the controls in place so the tank continues to spin.


* Hint 1: Free tanks are awarded at 15,000 and 100,000, missiles arrive after 10,000 and Supertanks show up after 20,000. This may change depending on how a machine is set up. Battlezone's score may wrap over at 10,000,000, but only three players know for sure (according to the Twin Galaxies scoreboard). Some time after 600,000 the Supertanks are replaced by the slower (lower scoring) regular tanks. This is a plus though, since it's safer to go after saucers. (I don't know if this switch is permanent, however.)


* Hint 2: Between attacks, drive forward into an open area, so you have a clear space to move around in during the next attack. During missile attacks, you'll usually have to turn slightly to the right to position the missile correctly on the left side of the screen.


* Hint 3: Keep an eye on the radar screen when a new tank appears, especially in the Supertank rounds. If the game puts one directly behind you, you have very little time to get away. Turn while driving away from it fast. Once you get clear, then you can back up and get it in front of you.


* Hint 4: Practice shooting while turning. You can either practice on tanks (which is risky) or by shooting barricades between attacks. It's a handy skill to master.

Beat Head (c) 11/1993 Atari Games.


- TRIVIA -


At the time, Atari were very keen to fund 'unusual' game concepts, such as "Toobin'" and Beat Head was one of those chosen. The game was intentionally surreal and is (to my mind) the only Atari game to use the sprite system to create full motion video until the Cojag era. However, the game mechanic was incredibly repetitive and once you'd beaten 5 opponents, not much really changed. As a consequence, Beat Head was written off as a tax loss and it was believed that all copies had been destroyed, this evidently was not the case.


The phrase 'Stella on Steroids' on the POST screen is a reference to the old Atari VCS, codenamed 'Stella'.

Berzerk (c) 10/1980 Stern Electronics.


Kill or be killed! The player as 'Humanoid' runs on 64,000 random maze patterns and must destroy robots by firing his weapon.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and one button.


- TRIVIA -


The title of this game comes from the series of books called 'The Berzerker Stories' by Fred Saberhagen. It's a novel about robots which go Berzerk and kill everybody.


Berzerk is the first robot killing game but the big selling point of Berzerk was that very speech  it was the first game to feature talking enemies, the speech synthesis technology of the time being so new that it cost $1000 to program each individual word into the games ROM.


The game also originally had a monochrome monitor, but when "Defender" was released in color, the company re-considered their display approach and re-designed the display using a color overlay board.


Berzerk was also the first game to attempt a bit of on-screen comedy  your robot opponents often fell foul of slapstick misfortune, shooting each other in the head or walking into walls and exploding in their attempts to kill you. And if you legged it out of a room without killing them all, the survivors would taunt you in their Speak & Spell voices: "Chicken  fight like a robot!". Okay, its not hilarious, but even Bob Monkhouse had to start somewhere.


'Evil Otto' was named for 'Dave Otto', who worked for Dave Nutting's Arcade Engineering group as R & D director at the time Alan McNeil did. 'Evil Otto' can be considered one of the most intimidating video game villains of all time. He is, and even travels through walls, preventing a player from loafing in the room. He resembles a bouncing smiley face, and has been called a 'Malicious basketball' by some.


Berzerk was Stern's first major video game success. It was made in both upright (approx. 37500 units) and cocktail (approx. 1200 units) models. Berzerk suffered a bit in sales due to frequent breakdowns of it's original giant sized optical 8-way joystick. Approximately 4200 orders were canceled by distributors and operators whose machines were frequently down from the opto-stick. Stern issued free WICO leaf switch sticks to operators after they had so much trouble with the optical stick, but this still hurt sales.


Berzerk shares a rather chilling distinction of being the first known game to be blamed for an actual player's death. In January 1981, Jeff Dailey was the first person to die playing a video game, a 19-year old Berzerk player, died of a massive heart attack right after playing his favorite game. His score was 16,660 (a very respectable score but disturbing for obvious reasons). On an equally distressing note, in October 1982 at the 'Friar Tuck Game Room' in Calumet City, Illinois: 18-year old Peter Burkowski, a physically healthy person who was alcohol-free and drug-free, inscribed his initials in Berzerk's top ten list twice in a matter of only fifteen minutes. A few seconds after that, he collapsed and died of a heart attack.


Berzerk inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Goin' Berzerk' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album.


A Berzerk unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Tron' and in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* An Interesting Quirk: The space between your man's head and body is not technically part of your man, so that shots that pass through this area (your 'neck') will not kill you.


* Hint 1: Always exit the mazes on the sides! If you exit the top or bottom, you will often start in a long corridor with many robots on both sides of you.


* Hint 2: The robots will always move toward you. Use this to your benefit when two (or more) robots are close to each other by moving your man back and forth, thus causing the robots to collide and annihilate each other.


* Hint 3: When seperated from the robots by a vertical wall, move up and down to place the robots on the same horizontal plane, where they will kill each other with shots aimed in your direction.


* Hint 4: The robots always walk toward you unless you're in their line of fire; then they will pause to shoot. There are eight directions you and they can shoot. The only way to survive the higher levels (10,000 points +) is to learn the blind spots of the robots. If you are in a robot's blind spot he poses no threat, and you can concentrate on blasting the others. The angle shots are almost never necessary. It is very difficult to hit a robot with an angle shot. When you shoot, your man stops moving, when you can't move, you are vulnerable. Make your shots count and don't bother wasting your time with angles unless you are on an early level and need the practice.


* Hint 5: Because the robots are shorter than you, try to avoid robots at the bottom edge of the screen. By the time you move low enough to get a shot they will have already fired. In contrast, if you come 'up' on robots from the bottom, you can shoot their feet and duck back down before their shot reaches you.


* Hint 6: Because your man is a lot taller than he is wide, it is very easy to avoid shots from above and below. Take out the robots to the sides of you first.


* Hint 7: If you poke your head above a wall just far enough to shoot above it, the robots on the other side of it can't shoot you. They will only hit the wall. ALWAYS use this tactic to kill most of the robots in a maze. When you are in the right position, just hold down the fire button. This will make your player stand still. You can inch your way very close to the deadly walls without fear of running into them. When shooting up or down, that trick doesn't work. If there is a wall between you and a robot above you, run to the right and start shooting up just past the wall. If you are lucky, the robot will walk into your fire before he gets a shot off. By design, if a robot is above you, he will lock into position directly in-line with your shots, and you will shoot each other's bullets. In early rounds you can overpower a robot and outgun him, but later the robots can keep up with you and you will be in a deadlock. To defeat him, shoot up and immediately walk to the right and he will walk into your bullet.


* Hint 8: Because the robots are attracted to you 'as the crow flies', they will tend to clump together and smash into each other. The best way to kill robots is to stand safely behind a wall and let them shoot and smash each other. The ball (Evil Otto) will also kill them. You can ignore some robots in the maze and let Otto kill them for you. Otto follows your position like the robots, so as he comes across the screen, lead him up and down into any remaining robots before you exit.


* Hint 9:The robots are programmed to avoid colliding into the sides of the deadly walls, but they can't detect the start or end of a wall. If a robot is below the end of a wall, you can move up and direct him into the wall end.


* Hint 10: In later rounds, all or the real action takes place in the first two or three seconds of a round. If you survive the initial shots from the robots, you are as good as done with the maze. When a new maze comes on screen, you are very vulnerable. Often you are in the line of fire of five robots. As the new maze slides on-screen, you can see it before the robots appear. Use this time to decide which way to run. Assume that there will be a robot in each 'room' or 'nook'. Shoot the robot right in front of you first, and then run toward his position. By running ahead, you will exit the line of fire of any robots above/below you and also the dreaded angle shots. Once you are out of their line of fire, you can re-enter their line of fire selectively and shoot them. Get to a safe barrier as soon as possible and wait for the robots to move into easy positions.


* Hint 11: The more robots that are in a maze (up to 11), the more time you have until Otto comes out. If the maze has only 1-3 robots, don't waste time shooting them unless they stand between you and the exit.


* Here is how the rounds progress:

Points - Robot Color - Shots fired

0-260 -Yellow - 0

260-1200 - Red - 1

1200-3000 - Light Blue - 2

3000-4500 - Yellow / Green - 3

4500-6000 - Purple - 4

6000-8000 - Yellow - 5

8000-10000 - White - One fast shot (2x speed)

10000-12000 - Light Blue - Two fast shots


This color system now repeats. At around 20,000 points, the robots stay light blue. Starting at about 10,000 pts. Berzerk becomes largely a game of luck. If you get an open maze with a lot of robots, there is not much you can do.

Blaster (c) 11/1983 Williams.


A first-person space flight simulator. Blast!!... or be Blasted!!

Controled with a 49-way joystick and three buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the "Defender" hardware.


Blaster was the official sequel to "Robotron - 2084", its attract mode went: The Robotrons have destroyed the last human family.


Originally known as 'Master Blaster', but they changed the name to avoid confusion with a pinball simulator called 'Bill Budges Raster Blaster' for the Apple computer. The 3-D effects of this game were all hand rendered which required thousands of hours of design work. Due to the expense of the pseudo-3D generating hardware, Blaster was released in very limited numbers.


When Blaster was first put out at a test location in late 1983, it had 30 waves and allowed you to continue a game by spending another credit. By the time the game went into production in early 1984, the program had been modified to have 20 waves, and no buy-ins allowed.


- UPDATES -


The very rare 30-wave version has more enemies and more diabolical levels.

Blasteroids (c) 1987 Atari Games.

A Blast from the Past! The ultimate in space action games return! Blasteroids has all of the provent player appeal of Atari's 1979 classic hit, "Asteroids" and adds all of the special gameplay features that today's player expect.


- TRIVIA -


The game was originally to have areas in which a certain ship form was required to get through them, but the game's production was pushed forward and it didn't get the tuning originally planned.


Background space-scapes, pictures of space ships, asteroids and other obstacles are actually digitized pictures of real-life objects.


- UPDATES -


The prototype version of Blasteroids has the programmer's head (Ed Rotberg) hidden in it.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Ed Rotberg (Prototype version only): To find his head, start a game on medium difficulty... complete the first wave, then pick the upper right hand wave next. Shoot the blue crystal rocks until they turn into spinning heads.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


*Here's A Way To Play Blood Bros. For As Long As You Want:

1) Get to the second screen (preferably without dying on the first screen).

2) Shoot the building on the right side of the screen and start shooting the trees in the background on the right. 20,000 points fly out from each bunch of trees. Continue.

3) That is basically it. A few problems occur and here is how to counter them:

3a) 5 men run across the back from the left and throw grenades: Just shoot the grenades before they get to you. Eventually they come out less often, and will stop altogether.

3b) The men on the right come out from the edge to shoot you: Same as above. They stop eventually.

3c) A plane flies over and drops bombs: Same as above. It stops after some time.

3d) After a certain amount of time a bird comes out to kill you: Let it. Only 2 birds ever come out (sometimes only 1) and then they also stop coming. This is why it pays not to die on the first screen.

4) Hold your finger on the button to keep shooting the trees (sticky-tape works well here) and prepare to get 'really' bored. Play the neighboring game so that you can keep an eye on it.


* Extra Live: On the 1-1 and 4-1 stages, the tin can be shot eight times to give you a free man. If you miss it, don't bother trying again - you only get one chance.

* Fight Against Hidden Agents:

1) GOLEM: In Subterra (the background with the cliffs on either side), there is a spike hanging down from the ceiling, suspended over the cliff. If you can knock down the spike, it falls into the pit. Then you just jump into the pit and you will not get spiked, you will stand on top of the fallen spike and enter through the door! To knock down the spike, you need to hit it twice with either your gauntlet or a projectile. Simply jump into the air and do the normal gauntlet throw move or whatever your projectile move is.

2) DIMENTHIA: In the Obsel desert, on the ground, amidst all those symbols, there is a circular figure with five lines in it, like dividing a pie into five even wedges. Once the round begins, throw your gauntlet. You can jump and ditch it away, even. You won't need it. Move to the circular figure and do the move to pick up the gauntlet. The character will bend down and touch the ground. When the character touches the circular figure, a portal is activated and the character is transported to Triax, to fight Dimentia.

3) CRANIAC: You get to him from the Black Armada background (This background is the one with a catwalk in the distance). Getting to the back platform is the key. Hold Block and move Up 2 or 3 times to jump back to the far away platform. Moving left or right makes you switch sides, down keeps you still and up or center makes you come right back to the front. To get to Craniac, jump back to the platform 3 times and hold down each time you get back there, in order to get as much time back there as possible. 5 seconds after returning from the third trip, a small Craniac will fly onto the platform. While he is there, jump back there again to be with him, holding down to wait there. The game will freeze and a message will come up stating that you will fight Craniac!

4) WRAITH: he is found from the Scorch HQ background. You get to Wraith by entering a 'trash talk' password after you win a match on this background. The password is UP(x3), Block. If it done correctly, 'WRAITH SUMMONED' appears on the screen.

5) RATCHET: On Nimbus, note the far left side of the platform... there is a line that separates the small edge part from the rest of the platform. This is the key. On the winning round, you must defeat the opponent so that either you or your opponent stays fully to the left of the line, in the edge part. Then, you enter a 'trash-talk' code: Hold Left, then Front Leg(x4), Block.

6) SHADOW: Beat your opponent 2-0 from any background (no round 3 allowed, folks....without using the Block button in any match and do the fatality on BOTH rounds).

7) BLOOD: Blood, like Shadow, can be found from any background. To fight Blood, you need to have a perfect round and then win the match. Note that if you get a Perfect in the first round, Blood will not appear until the match (win 2 out of 3) is over. If you do this, the dead opponent explodes and Blood comes alive!

8) SIN: Beat all of the 8 regular fighters.


* SPECIAL Ending: When you have beaten all of the regular fighters and all of the hidden agents, you will get to see the credits and at the end of the credits, a code and a telephone number is given to you :).

Bomb Jack (c) 10/1984 Tehkan.


Collect bombs around the world!


- TRIVIA -


Round 2 contains the music of 'Lady Madonna', by The Beatles.


Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Tecmo Game Music - 28XA-95) on 25/09/1986.


- UPDATES -


The older version (set 2) says 'YOU ARE LUCY' instead of 'YOU ARE LUCKY'.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hint 1: An important piece of information to remember is that you can pick up the bombs in a certain order to get the maximum points. If you pick up most of the bombs while their fuses are lit, you get the following bonuses (# Bombs - Bonuses):

20 - 10,000 pts.

21 - 20,000 pts.

22 - 30,000 pts.

23 - 50,000 pts.

So of course, you'll want to try to get 23 each time (This is of course, VERY difficult!). The P (Power) coin appears after every ninth bomb is collected. The points value of the P coin ranges from 100 (Blue) to 2000 (Silver). Since the color changes each time BJ jumps, you can control the bonus level by making small jumps until the coin turns silver.


* Hint 2: The B (Bonus) coin appears every 5,000 points, and advances the bonus multiplier by 1. There is a maximum of 5 B coins per level.


* Hint 3: Picking up the S (Special) coin awards one free credit. It will also take you to the next level automatically.


* Hint 4: You can control where the mechanical bird appears by holding the joystick in the opposite direction. Example: Hold the joystick to the Right as soon as the round starts and the mechanical bird appears on the left of the screen. If the stick is held diagonally, the bird appears in the opposite corner.

Boot Hill represented a pretty major leap forward for arcade technology. Those detailed background graphics, that lush use of glowing colour... Sadly, though, it was all a big con. Boot Hill's colourful backdrops were achieved by the unscientific method of sticking a big bit of cellophane with the background painted on it over the screen, with the all-white graphics then superimposed on top.

2) Keep B1 pressed and enter the following sequence: Up(x5), Right(x6), Down, Left(x4). '(c) 1981 NAMCO LTD.' will be added at the bottom of the screen.


* Just as in "Time Pilot", there is a way you can stay on a level for as long as you want (This works best on level 2): Stay away from all the bases, and fly horizontally from left to right. Just fire continuously at all the formations that come at you. The other ships will never be able to come after you. There is no time limit in the game, and it never gets any harder. You can stay on this level for as long as you want. It takes a VERY LONG TIME, though, to get a LARGE score.

The controls were a big pain. The players gripped handles that could be swiveled left and right to simulate punching. The problem was, they kept being broken by players. More and more was done to strengthen these controls until they were capable of finally being able to withstand public abuse.

Breaker's Revenge (c) 07/1998 Visco.

Game ID: 0245


A small update to Breaker's containing one new selectable character, Saizo and different colored backgrounds.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and four buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware.


A serious bug: Using a USA bios rom if you insert a coin on the 'winners dont use drugs' screen on a single slot the games will use the neogeo bios s1 tileset rather than the game tiles, this causes most of the graphics to be hidden and the games to be unplayable, it will also end up using the mainboard z80 bios so sound will be broken, the games should fix themselves if you let them run another attact loop after gameover, on a multi-slot the games will reset. This is one of the first 4 'gigapower' games, the bug was fixed after that.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Unlock Bai-Hu: At the character selection screen, press Up at the same time on both 1P&2P joystick.

Bubble Bobble (c) 08/1986 Taito.

Game ID: A78


- TRIVIA -


Licensed to Romstar for US manufacture and distribution (10/1986).


Some bootlegs of this game are known as "Bobble Bobble", "Miss Bubble II" and "Super Bobble Bobble".


The title of this game, Bubble Bobble, is a cross between the words 'bubble' and the name of the heroes: Bub and Bob.


In 1996, Taito announced that they lost the original source code program to Bubble Bobble following a reorganisation - when it came to the recent ports and sequels, they had to work from program disassembly, playing the game and (mainly) the various home computer ports.


Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Taito Game Music - 28XA-110) on 25/01/1987

* US release.


Revision 3:

* Software version 5.1.

* US release (11/1986).

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Unlimited Run And Rapid Fire: At the main title screen, press Left, Jump, Left, 1P, Left, Fire, Left, 1P. If this is done correctly there will be a message in the bottom left corner of the title screen a red POWER UP!.


* Original Bubble Bobble: At the title screen press Shoot, Jump, Shoot, Jump, Shoot, Jump, Right, 1P. It will say at the bottom of screen ORIGINAL GAME. The game will give the PORTALS in some screens, if you can get in them you will get LOADS of diamonds.


* The 'Super Bubble Bobble' Code: At the title screen press 1P, Jump, Fire, Left, Right, Jump, 1P, Right. This will change the Bubble Bobble logo in 'Super Bubble bobble' and the game will change under several points of view: different platform colors, different order for monster appearances... The most important change is that this is the ONLY way to see the REAL ending of the game (and you'll need also to kill the final baddie in a 2P play, 'cause the game wants to promote the 'power of friendship'... see below). If the *super* trick is performed on the original version of Bubble Bobble, the game lets you choose at the very start between 'normal' and 'super' game, while the bootlegs don't.


* Secret Tombs: Make it to level 20 without dying and a door appears -- it leads to a 'secret tomb', a level full of diamonds. There are secret tombs at levels 20 and 30, also. Make it to level 50 without dying and a strange, bee-hive-shaped door appears; enter it and you warp to level 70. DON'T kill the drunks on level 50, or the door disappears; bubble them and wait! Btw, with two players, only one of the players must survive unharmed to get the secret door.


* Paffing A Skel: Skel is that nasty white monster that comes after you when you've taken too long; with two players, two Skels will appear. If one player is killed by 'his' Skel, then he can collide with his partner's Skel 'WHILE HE IS STILL FLICKERING'. If the player's icon is still flickering, the other player's Skel will disappear (poof!), with no harm to the once-slain character.


* The Trick!: At the end of a level, sometimes all of the bubbles on the screen will inexplicably turn into food (even if there was no candy cane on that level). If the tens and hundreds digits of either player's score match when the last monster of a level is popped, then the bubbles will turn into food! Ex: scores of 10,770 1,350,990 or 576,000 will produce 'the trick.' Usually, my partner and I kill everything in a level, and as one player moves to pop the last monster, the other player will 'get the trick' by blowing bubbles against a wall until the score is correct. Notice that you _do_ get the points for popping the last monster, so if you're by yourself, you have to work your score so that the tens and hundreds digits will match _after_ the points for the last monster are added....


* Blowing Yourself Through: It is possible (though quite difficult) to bounce on a bubble at the top of the screen and ride it 'through' the top, so that you emerge at the bottom of the screen.


* Full Ending Sequence: Beat the game in 2 Player in Super mode and you'll get the full end sequence.


* High Score Codes: After getting a high score, enter your initials as:

SEX - Pitch fork-flying cakes/vegetables/etc across the screen, turn enemy into 6k diamonds.

TAK - Octopus-turns bubbles into X's at end of level.

STR - Flamingo-turns bubbles into smiling turds at end of level.

KTT - Beer-turns bubbles into pizzas at end of level, what a perfect match !!!

... - Knife-flying cakes/vegetables/etc across the screen, turns enemy into 6k diamonds.

I.F, MTJ, NSO, KIM, YSH - Coke can-flying sunflowers across the screen, turn enemies into 6k diamonds.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* 'Mad Dash': J.D. Lowe, the current world record holder adds some suggestions... Something that very few players use is something I call 'Mad Dash'. If you watch as the chef is drawn on the screen, he walks up/down ladders at approx. 8 steps a second. So, in theory, if you can press the up and down arrows faster than 8 times a second, you can go faster. This is very helpful on later levels like Level 20. This does not work on going left and right, because the steps are smaller, and the computer has to draw the chef facing you again if you let go of the controller. It's a bit complicated, but like I said earlier, it can be very helpful.


* Peppers Appearances: The peppers do not appear randomly on the screen; in fact, they appear after so many ingredients have fallen to the bottom of the screen...

Level 1 - Peppers appear after 4, 8, and 12 ingredients have dropped.

Level 2 - After 5, 7, and 13 ingredients.

Level 3 - 4, 8, and 13.

Level 4 - 6, 16, 22, 29.

Level 5 - 3, 6, 9.

Level 6 - ????


* Hint 1: Enemies can't turn around immediately, so you can follow them around temporarily.


* Hint 2: The best tactic is generally to stand halfway across a piece of food, wait for enemies to appear on the food's edge, and then drop the food and enemies at once. Always lure the enemies onto the highest portion of the screen, and then drop them. This has several advantages: it clears more burger pieces, plus it means that units on lower levels may wander into the cascading pieces, killing them also.


* Hint 3: Leave LOTS of room around yourself when going up ladders - the sprites in Burger Time are somewhat bigger than the visible characters.


* Hint 4: When enemies first appear, you have 1/4 sec to go through them, if you need to.


* IMPORTANT: If you die while the last piece of food is falling into place, the game will NOT deduct a man from your game!

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* General Tips:

1) Airplanes are worth 10000, choppers 7000, tanks and trucks are 5000, 3000, and 2000. Killing people and motorcycles (and rocks) won't get you many points -- don't bother unless they get in your way.

2) A well-placed grenade will destroy two choppers.

3) If you are in a corner and a chopper is firing at you, run farther into the corner. Even if you're already IN the corner, if it sees you trying to move toward the corner, you won't die.

4) If you find yourself trapped by incoming bullets, spin the trackball down and to one side (but mostly down). This will cause your character to 'duck and roll'. If you are rolling, you can't be hit.

5) Kill the snipers (the guys in gray bullet-proof suits). Half the time you'll get a grenade for killing him. If you don't, two medics will come running out to reclaim the body. Shoot these medics as much as possible! They will drop four grenades. Pick up these grenades as quickly as possible and shoot the medics again for another four grenades.

6) On the level one screen with the sliding doors: shoot out the doors immediately upon starting the level. This will stop the guys from lobbing grenades at you.

7) Airplanes are hard to kill. The best method is by using machine gun or bazooka gun on it. In the absence of a super-gun, you can lead a grenade ABOVE where it is on the screen. If you don't get it, and the three bombs are being dropped right on you, it IS possible to stand BETWEEN where two bombs are coming down. You WON'T die!

8) If you want a lot of grenades, shoot the white 'super' soldier. Guys from M.A.S.H. will go to pick up him. Every shot to these guys gives you one grenade.

9) When there's nothing good to shoot on the screen, fire at a bush. This is the way to get extra gunnery! Sometimes you'll only get more grenades, but you'll eventually get a super-gun!


* Tips For Specific Enemies:

1) The giant chopper that shows up at the end of screen 4 on level one doesn't give you any points until you destroy it. Shooting the orange bullets won't knock off any points toward killing the chopper. Only shoot the orange bullets if they're in your way. Otherwise, spend all your time shooting the chopper. Don't waste any grenades on the chopper--it doesn't do as much damage as your gun (and you have unlimited bullets).

2) The giant submarine that shows up at the end of screen 4 on level two can be sunk three times as fast if you shoot at the conning tower (the top-most part of the sub). It has also been determined that you can get by the submarine WITHOUT killing it... just avoid it until it submerges three times and it will destroy itself. Note that you don't get the points for killing it if it self-destructs.

3) The semi-truck that shows up at the end of screen 4 on level three will self-destruct if you destroy the CAB (the blue section in the front of it). On this screen you actually get the point for it as well. It is easiest to kill it with the machine gun and/or bazooka gun, but in the absence of either of these, throw grenades at the cab (leading the throw by about four inches). It is MUCH easier to destroy the cab rather than destroying all the attack sections that it drops off.

4) The three CPUs that show up at the end of screen 4 on level four can actually be destroyed with only 2 grenades (I had to do this once when my grenade supply got low), but the best strategy is to lob five grenades at one of the outside CPUs (note that you can only have four grenades per player in the air at any given time, so space them out a bit), then go for the CENTER one (with another five grenades). The final CPU can simply be shot with the standard rifle, and if you're standing on the opposite side of the screen from it, it won't be able to hit you. Don't waste any more grenades.

5) Once you learn how to defeat the final menace (at the end of screen 4 on level five -- the final level) you can get by it (rather) painlessly. Go all the way to one side. Use your gun to shoot out the two surrounding machines that are shooting at you. As soon as they are both gone, lob three grenades at the center machine. By this time, the two outer machines that you shot out have regenerated and are firing at you. Shoot them out again, followed by another volley of three grenades to the center machine. Repeat until the center machine is gone. This requires 20 to 40 grenades, so stock up on the last level (5-4). That is what that final level was for.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hint: Your character jumps backwards when hit by an enemy. When you're trying to quickly cross some areas where you're likely to take damage, this can be a bad thing; it can cause you to stay in the dangerous area much longer. So, to reduce the damage, turn back just before you get hit. This will cause the impact to push you -forward-, getting you out of danger more quickly.

Game ID: 009493-009504


A two player competitive game! Players controlled two vintage aircraft... a bi-plane and a blimp. The aircraft flew back and forth over a canyon filled with numbered targets. His objective was to time the release of his bombs so as to hit the most targets. He played continously, until he used up his alotment of misses. As the targets were destroyed and the canyon got emptied, the competition really heated up.

Controlled with a button marked 'drop'.

Canyon Bomber is Howie Delman's second Atari project ("Super Bug" was his first). The author describes his game as 'upside-down Breakout' and says it was a far superior two-player competitive game than when played one person versus the computer. He modified the "Sprint 2"'s circuitry, then programmed it.

Capcom Bowling (c) 08/1988 Incredible Technologies.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hint 1: To get a strike most of the time, position the ball between the 3rd and 4th dots behind the foul line. Also, move the ball closer to the foul line, but do NOT cross it. The closer you move the ball to the foul line, the more you may need to nudge your ball a little to the left. This is because when the ball travels slow enough on the lane, it will hook to the right.


* Hint 2: If the ball is over the line when you position your ball, and you have not thrown it, you can move it back behind the line with no foul (which is necessary if over half of the ball is across the line...a foul will be called if you try throwing it from that position).

Centipede (c) 06/1981 Atari.

Game ID: 136001


Shoot the insects in a mushroom patch!


- TRIVIA -


A bootleg was released by Olympia as the same name.

A French hack of this game is known as "Mill Pac".

An Italian hack is known as "Magic Worm".


Centipede, completed in 1981, was an Atari coin-operated game that swiftly won a wide following in the arcades. Apart from its smooth game play, Centipede was praised for its refreshing approach to screen colors and for its whimsical mushroom world.


The first coin-op game designed by a woman, Dona Bailey. But Ed Logg did the majority of the work on Centipede, Dona only came up with the prototype idea, where the mushrooms were indestructible and it was more like "Space Invaders". Like "Pac-Man", this game has special appeal to women.


* The Creation of Centipede: Centipede was written by veteran Atari designer Ed Logg, who has become something of a legend in the world of video games, and a young game programmer who was credited with bringing a gentler touch to the world of video games with the enchanted mushroom patch. Steve Calfee: "Ed Logg is the world's greatest games designer. He's done the most, the best games. His line up starts with "Asteroids", which probably still is the biggest run we ever did. He's in [a long line of games]. He's kind of like Pete Rose; he has the most hits and he's also probably got the most strike outs. He just goes up to bat.".


* Remembrances from the Video Game Masters: The mushroom patch with its tenacious, never-say-die centipedes, bouncing spiders, mushroom-laying fleas and transforming scorpions provided an imaginative leap for players, just as did the hoards of aliens in "Tempest", the outer space adventures of "Asteroids", the eerie battlefields of "Battle Zone" and even the frightful scenarios of "Missile Command". Of these times, and the games that emerged from Atari, Rich Adam said: "We were a young group of fun people who were sort of treading on untrodden territory. We were out exploring what technology could do to entertain adolescent minds, and we were adolescent minds.".

In the early days of personal computers, before they became commonplace, and before sophisticated gaming programs were available for them, the arcades (and wherever else the coin-operated games were located) were the portals into these new fantasy worlds. And a river of quarters carried players into the electronic realms. Dan Pliskin described the coin-operated video game business as follows: "It was a wacky, extremely competitive business. I was there when coin-operated games were earning $8 billion in quarters a year. These games were outgrossing the record industry and the movie industry combined, in quarters! And when you looked at who was manufacturing these games, it was just a couple of Japanese companies and a few American companies.... There was incredible competition, all for kids' lunch and church money!

The quarters are still rolling in. Dan Plishkin continued: "People say that video games have already seen their heyday and business has definitely gone downhill. Maybe it has gone downhill. Maybe it's only $4 billion worth of quarters now. It's still one heck of an industry.".


* Popular from the Start: The prototype games were hand-built, wire-wrapped, one-of-a kinds that were created by the development team prior to ordering the circuit boards for the mass-produced versions. With just a single machine, people would come in at all hours of the night to play a new game.Dan Plishkin: "One of the things that kind of allowed everybody at Atari to have kind of a loose and enjoyable relationship was that management was kind of loose, too. An example of that happened with one of Howard Delman's games. I can't remember which one it was, but we sent the one and only prototype wire-wrapped version of Howie's game off to the AMOA (Amusement and Music Operators Association) show with strict orders not to sell it. "Of course the game was sold anyway, and a new prototype had to be assembled back at the labs. Dan Plishkin continued: "Several months later Howie gets a call from the person who bought this game. It had stopped collecting money and he wanted to know how to change the settings to make it play longer, or something, to see if it would earn more money. Howie had to tell the guy that if it ever collected any money at all, it was a miracle because it didn't have any coin routines at all. It had none, because we had wired it for free-play when we sent it to the AMOA show!".


* The Great 25-Cent Escape: Especially in the early 1980s a great many newspaper and magazine articles were written about the meaning of and possible consequences of the wave of video games that seemed to allure so many kids, and adults, to the arcades. But at the heart of it might have been the promise of a quick escape into another world. Rich Adam: "I kind of figured out, maybe years after the fact, what I think the lure of video games is. It's because people have so little control over their lives. This is especially true with kids, but even adults often have little control over the day-to-day part of their lives. You have to go to work. You don't get to control that much of your life. But for a quarter you can control this very complex machine. You can command it. For a quarter that's quite a bargain, to be able to do that for five minutes. . . . When you're good at a game it gives you an incredible sense of power over the whole environment.".


Centipede was the 1st UL (Underwriter's Laboratories) approved game.


Atari's second bestselling coin-op game. Approximately 55,000 units were produced.


Note: In test mode you can cycle through the different graphical objects used in the game (the player, a mushroom, a spider, a scorpion, a flea and a grasshopper). Grasshopper?! Yes, the game was to originally have had grasshoppers but they were taken out. You can still see them in the test however.


Note 2: 'Centipede' is also the name of a terrifying, man-eating monster of the size of a mountain. This Japanese legend say that the dragon king of that particular lake asked the famous hero Hidesato to kill it for him. The hero slew it by shooting an arrow, dipped in his own saliva, into the brain of the monster. The dragon king rewarded Hidesato by giving him a rice-bag; a bag of rice which could not be emptied and it fed his family for centuries.


Centipede inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Ode To A Centipede' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album.


A Centipede unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', in the 1983 movie 'James Bond 007 - Never Say Never Again', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1984 movie 'Body Double', in the 1985 movie 'Teen Wolf', in the 1986 movie 'Running Scared', in the 1987 movie 'Death Wish 4 - The Crackdown', in the 1995 movie 'Species' and in the 1996 movie 'House Arrest'.


In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins inluding: "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".


MB (Milton Bradley) released a bordgame based on Atari's Centipede.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Easier Mode: Play as player 2 on a cocktail cabinet, the spider becomes easier to hit in later levels.


* Hint 1: On levels that have complete centipedes (all in one piece), the fleas never come out. You can clear all the mushrooms on these levels.(Of course it's the easiest on the first level!). You can start building a shield of mushrooms on the lower levels, and that way you don't have to work about fleas dropping, or poisoned mushrooms either (If you're really patient, build a shield around yourself, and just shoot spiders for the whole game).


* Hint 2: Note that a very important factor in the game is the rate of feed of the new centipede segments when one reaches the bottom. You can manipulate this feed value, to get past the really impossible feed! First, the feed rate doesn't advance until the first time a centipede segment actually feeds in. Then it advances on a straight point basis. It seems to turn over every 300K or so. But the rate of feed increases much faster when you're scoring while centipede segments are actually feeding in.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hint 1: In the early stages, try to fly as low as possible - this way the fighters will not shoot you, and you are low enought to shoot the ground targets without being shot. Since this only works when you're in the air, and not when you're on the ground, it only works well on levels 1 and 3.


* Hint 2: To ensure that the tank won't arrive when you're picking up hostages, barely tap the joystick up between each hostage. This will cause the helicopter to lift off a little and reset the timer that causes the tanks to arrive.


* Hint 3: On level 2, you can land on the water under the boat when dropping off your men and they will climb up the side of the boat. This stops the planes from coming down and shooting you.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Extra Life: On the first level when you are on a Lion and have to jump through burning hoops, jump backwards through a hoop and then forwards through it again. The next hoop to appear will then change into an extra life.


* Here's A Small Hidden Bonus: On the first (flaming hoops) level, jump over the first flaming urn, then jump backwards over it. A bonus item should rise vertically from it; grab it and it's worth 2000 points. Ideally, you should time it so that jumping back over the urn coincides with the passage of a hoop over the urn.

Note: this is for the 'level select' versions. On the other version, it seems to work on the second urn.

Cloak and Dagger (c) 12/1983 Atari.

Game ID: 136023


- TRIVIA -


A Cloak and Dagger unit appears in the 1984 movie 'Cloak and Dagger'.


This game was in development independently from the movie of the same name under the title 'Agent X'. When the game was about 70% completed and the movie was about 40% done, the movie producers and editors came Atari to see if he had a game they could film as backdrop to the movie scenes which needed a 'Cloak and Dagger like spy game'. Atari agreed to change the name of its game to 'Cloak and Dagger' and they put a couple of tid-bits into their script which referred to 'Agent X' (Dabny Colman's character). The game actually arrived on the scene about 2 months before the movie was released. It was tested under the name 'Agent X' in it's initial field test (about 5 months before the movie was released), but was never produced as anything but 'Cloak and Dagger'. There were about 5000 games produced which made it into the market place.

Bandai released a boardgame based on this video game (same name): A simple roll-and-move type game, with symbols on the board indiciating what happens when you land on that spot. There are multiple choices on which direction to go, but not too much in the way of required thinking. There are many different boards that you progress through, each 'board' representing one 'stage' of the game.


Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Capcom Game Music - 28XA-94) on 25/08/1986.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Here's A Hot Way To Kill The Soldiers Without Going Anywhere Near Them: At the end of each area, when the enemy soldiers are pouring out of the gate from their compound, move your commando to the bottom of the screen and shoot down. Your shots will come down from the top of the screen, killing the soldiers as they come out of the gate.


* This will let you rack up big points and all the extra men you can: On the first stage there is a cliff on the right side of the screen. The bad guys will jump off the end of this cliff and attack you. If you walk until the bad guys START jumping off and then stop you can stand there and kill them until you get sick of playing or until you reach the max extra men.

If you plan on playing thru the rest of the game you should stop at the max amount of extra men. If you just sit there the enemies will get faster and faster so the rest of the game will be harder.

A game of strategy and skill! The object of Crazy Ballon is to guide a delicate swaying ballon through a maze of pin wheel obstacles. You have 4 control buttons and you have the ability to move your ballon in any direction. Don't take too long, because of you are slow, a boggey man erupts on the screen and forces you to move. Just when you think you have the maze all fogured out, pin wheels attack your ballon forcing you to take evasive action.

Crazy Climber was Fujiwara's first game.


A Crazy Climber unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Rocky III'.


Bandai released a boardgame based on this videogame (same name): This game has you playing cards to move to the top of a building. Like in the arcade, there is the peril that people seem to drop just about anything out there windows at random times. Each card allows you to move to a particular postion relative to where you currenty are (for example, a chocie of straight up two squares or up two squares and left or right one). However, there must be an open window that is not occupied by another player for it to be a legal move. Whenever a player passes certain checkpoints, the spinner is spun to see if anything falls from the windows. If you're hit on the head, you drop down to the next open window. There is also a gorilla that knocks you all the way down if you're unfortunate enough to be hit by him. First one to get to the top of the building and escape on the helicopter wins.


- UPDATES -


Only the US version has the realistic-sounding voice samples.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* A Trick: In the second building, when you arrive at the electrical sign, choose the left path. Then put yourself under the electrical wire (rightmost window of the left path) but keep both joysticks pressed. (Keep the left joystick pressed Up and the right joystick pressed Down, others configurations should work). After a few seconds your climber will become red with white hair and electricity won't have effect on it.


* Secret Password: Enter the name 'jordan.ltd' in the high score table and you get two free credits. This only works on the Japanese and bootleg versions of the game (Although the password code is still present in the US version, the high score table entry has been crippled to only allow 3 letters, so you can't enter the code).

Crazy Kong - Part II (c) 03/1981 Falcon.


- TRIVIA -


A bootleg of this game is known as "Monkey Donkey".

Some other bootlegs under the same name were made by Jeutel (France), Alca and Orca.

A special bootleg was also made on the "Scramble" hardware.


Crazy Kong is not a bootleg of "Donkey Kong"!! Falcon DID have a license from Nintendo, but it was NOT for the US. Crazy Kong was supposed to be for sale outside the US (South America, Europe, etc.), but the lag in production of arcade DK's by Nintendo for a 3 month period during 1981-82 made demand for any DK type game go through the roof. At this time, Nintendo of America was moving from NY-NJ to Redmond WA and there was a 4 month backlog on orders. This opened the door for the illegal Crazy Kongs to fill the demand. Approximately 20,000 Crazy Kong were distributed illegally in the U.S.


- UPDATES -


The "Scramble" hardware bootleg has additional ingame music and the 'Warp to level 2' trick doesn't work.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Warp To Level 2 (doesn't work on the "Scramble" hardware bootleg version): Climb up to the second beam (the one with the hammer right by it). Walk to the right so that Mario is still facing away from you (you can see his back) and is suspended off the side of end of the beam, then jump to the right. He'll 'fall thru' the bottom of the screen and clear it, as if he had climbed all the way to the top.


* A Trick: On the conveyor belt level, Grab the bottom hammer (the one on the row with the full length conveyor belt) and go all the way to the right side of the screen. Push the joystick Right and he'll drop the hammer. Sometimes it'll be in the up position and sometimes it'll be sitting toward the left of Mario. If it's in the up position, jump up and grab it and keep repeating until he drops it on the left position. After this, you can walk away and anything that comes into contact with it will be splatted (Good way of getting extra points). After a few seconds, the hammer will disappear, but the stuff will still splat when it hits where the hammer should be. NOTE: This trick only works on the second level or higher!

Some bosses' character design in this game seem to have been inspired by popular horror movies, this seems true for three bosses in particular:

Stage 2 Boss: A parody of Jason Voorhees from 'Friday the 13th movie' series.

Stage 4 Boss: A distant parody of Leatherface from 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' movie series.

Stage 5 Boss: A parody of Freddy Krueger from 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' movie series.

- UPDATES -


There are quite a few differences between the 4 player version and the two player versions of the same game:


4 PLAYER VERSION:

* This is a two-button game (punch & kick).

* Character's energy is represented by a numerical hit point value which is always on countdown to zero. Additional hit points may be added by inserting more coins into each player's corresponding coin slot.

* Characters can use a reversal kick which is automatically activated if an opponent is behind you as you press the kick button. This kick knocks down enemies (except bosses) with a single hit!

* The gun has limited ammo, however it is possible to pick it up again if an enemy knocks it off your hand. Also each gunshot is as strong as 3 punches or kicks and knocks down most enemies in one shot.

* You can play the extra stage (enemy boss revenge) more than once.


2 PLAYER VERSIONS:

* Commonly seen as a two-button game (punch & kick) but actually is a three-button game (can be confirmed in the game's test mode).

* Character's energy is represented by a lifebar which only decreases with enemy attacks.

* There is a timer as well as a credit counter.

* The third button is a reversal attack, which works as another kick button since you can use a pretty effective 3-hit combo (back kick, back kick, roundhouse kick). However you can't use this button to kick downed opponents.

* The gun has unlimited ammo, however you will lose it permanently if an enemy knocks it off your hand. Also the gun is now just as weak as a normal punch or kick and it takes 3 consecutive shots to knock down a normal enemy.

* You can play the extra stage (enemy boss revenge) only once.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Unlimited Credits: Successfully complete the entire game two consecutive times.

Crystal Castles (c) 07/1983 Atari.

Game ID: 136022


- TRIVIA -


The game was originally supposed to be a variation on the mega-hit "Asteroids" and the working title was Toporoids! It featured a one-legged robot and/or a spaceship placed in 3-D mazes lined with asteroids and the goal was (of course) to shoot them. The mazes were similar to those in Crystal Castles.


The character 'Bentley Bear' was originally named 'Braveheart Bear' in the released prototypes. But, Atari ran into trouble over that name from the American Indians and so had to change it.


Originally, FXL designed the game so that Bentley could jump while in a tunnel. But he decided to take that ability away when he saw Bentley's head popping through the roof!


All of the musical themes in the game are from works of classical music. The tune when you first start the game and the bonus life music, are both from The Mephisto Waltz by Liszt. The last gem bonus music is from one of the scenes in Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite. And, the triumphant theme played when you complete level 10 is of course from The 1812 Overture, again from Tchaikovsky.


On two of the mazes in the game, FXL has built into the structure initials of friends of his. On Hidden Spiral, the DES stands for Desiree McCrorey, who holds a contest record on "Mr. Do!". SSM is Sam Mehta, who came in 2nd in a "Centipede" contest held by Atari. And BBM stands for Brian McGhee, a former Atari game designer. On Berthilda's Palace, the initials are harder to make out, as they are cutouts in the floor. EDG is the initials of Eric Ginner, while MAR stands for Mark Robichek. Both of these were famous video game players at the time Crystal was made and are still known by many. Other initials appear in the game, on the above-mentioned scoreboard. While many are made up, some stand for real people. FXL appears in the top 3 spots on a new, or newly reset, game scoreboard and he also appears at other places in the top 250 initials. MEC appears more than once also. This stands for Mark Cerny, a fellow designer at Atari. He is responsible for "Major Havoc" and "Marble Madness".


Note: The formula for calculating the points given for the last gem bonus on a particular level and board number is 1000 + ((((level x 4) - 1) - (4 - board)) x 100).


Approximately 5,380 units were produced (~4,880 upright and ~500 cocktail).


A Crystal Castles units appears in the 1984 movie 'Gremlins'.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Warps: There's a 'continue option' warp on the first board. It won't take you any higher than level 8, though.

1) The first warp is behind the palace on the upper-right hand corner of the first board. Go there then jump. It'll take you to level 3.

2) The second warp: get the hat, run to an elevator, and at the back corner of the hidden ramp, jump before the hat expires. The warp always gives you four lives (not including the one you're on) and takes you to level 5.

3) The third warp is on the third screen of Level 5, titled "Crossroads." It is extremely easy to trigger; just move to the very upper left corner and jump. You will be transported to the first screen of Level 7, again with four lives to spare. There are no other warps.


* A Trick: If you jump at least 128 times in the front right corner of any maze, the next maze that is fully drawn from the beginning will have a string of the words ATARI stretched across the middle of the screen. It disappears on the next maze, unless you are playing a two-player game, in which case it can appear on two screens.


* Another Trick: On Level 5, Berthilda's Palace grab the hat and enter the large door where Berthilda is. Run over her for 3000 points, then head to the corner of the room (where Berthilda was) and jump. The initials FXL will appear in the lower-right hand corner of the screen, which stands for Franz Lanziger, one of the designers of Crystal Castles!


* This Trick Is Free: When the machine is in its demo mode, wait until the first stage appears. When Bentley gets killed, hold down BOTH jump buttons and the accounting screen, which shows customer play information, will appear.


* Secret Message: When you complete level 10, a special screen appears that says, I GIVE UP : YOU WIN  YOU MUST BE _______________.

What goes in the blank depends on the number of lives you have left.

For 1 life, fill in AMAZINGLY GOOD;

For 2, RIDICULOUSLY GOOD;

For 3, FANTASTICALLY GOOD;

For 4, VERY GOOD;

For 5, AN EXPERT;

and for 6, A VIDEO WIZ.

Defender (c) 12/1980 Williams.


- TRIVIA -


Some bootlegs of this game are known as "Defence Command", "Defense Command" and "Mirage" (by Jeutel).


The macho man's game!! Defender was noted for its sound and visual effects and extremely hard gameplay. That didn't stop players from racking up millions of points on the game. Literally minutes from the opening of the AMOA Jarvis and his team were burning new ROMs for the display game due to the fact they plugged the first burn into the board backwards and fried them! Due to the intimidating controls, no one played the game and there were even rumors saying "Pac-Man" and Defender would bomb and "Rally X" would be the next hit. Not only did Defender have the most buttons to use during gameplay (It had 5 buttons, plus a joystick) but it was also the first game to have events occur outside of the players main screen.


Defender inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Defender' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album.


A Defender unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Terms of Endearment', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks' and in the 1983 movie 'Koyaanisqatsi - Life out of Balance'.


MB (Milton Bradley) released a boardgame based on this video game (same name) in 1983: Win the most points by using your Defender ships to protect humanoids from waves of aliens. A set of chance cards will bring the different aliens (bombers, landers and humanoids) into play. Movement is determined with a spinner. Players can move their defenders and aliens.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* See Credits: To see the designers credits, do the following while in game play: Down, Reverse, 1P Start, Thrust, Reverse, 2P Start, Fire, Down, 1P Start, Thrust and Fire.


* The International Date Line: There are reverse lines for swarmers and mutants (aka the 'International Date Line'). If this line is between you and the type of enemy in question, they will travel the opposite direction around the planet to get you (I.e. they won't cross this line to get to you). If a mutant, say, is following you and you cross the mutant reverse line (to the left of the Big Mountain) it will suddenly reverse direction and go around the other way. The same is true for the swarmer reverse line (located approximately where your ship starts each wave). This doesn't affect swarmers that you are following behind. If you're on one side of the line and a pod is on the other and you shoot it open the swarmers will fly away from you and you can get in behind them immediately. The best use of these lines is where there are lots of swarmers and/or mutants that you don't want to hassle with. You stay near the line in question and go back and forth over it to keep the enemy in question on the other side of the planet. Especially useful in space and waves that get really hairy.


* Freeze!!: You can freeze a Defender machine by picking up all ten humans (on any wave, but Wave 1 is your greatest chance at success), stopping all forward motion of your ship, quieting the screen down (i.e. having no enemies moving around on it) and setting all the humans straight down quickly. This seems to work better were the terrain is very close to the bottom of the screen. Every thing will freeze, but you can still move your ship up and down. Thrusting will break the spell, so to speak. If you do pick a spot with shallow terrain, some humans will go thru the bottom of the screen and appear suspended in mid-air near the top. This trick is good during marathon games when you've reached Wave 256 and need a breather.


* Some top players begin each round by shooting their own men, except for one, which they pick up. This keeps mutants from developing, but it also means that the world explodes if you lose your last humanoid. It probably goes without saying that this can be considered an 'advanced' trick...


* When you get your last official guy before 1,000,000, every time you score, you'll get an extra man. The trick we used was to win 100+ ships between 990,000 and 1,000,000, thus fooling the game based on where score rolls over rather than where ships roll over. The version where you win 100+ ships has been tested, the version where you win 256+ ships never was because:

a) For every point scored in Defender from 990,000 to 999,975 you will win one extra ship and smart bomb.

b) If you suicide on something, including a shot but not including hyperspace (because dying from hyperspace awards no points), you will lose one ship, but also gain one (net effect on ships is zero) plus one smart bomb.

c) For winning n ships in Defender from 990,000 to 999,975, including suicides, you will have to wait n x 10,000 points after passing 1M before the game's accounting balances and it awards ships properly at 10,000 point intervals again. d. The score returns to zero every 1 million, meaning that if you had won 100 ships the machine would have to wait 1 million points to begin awarding ships again. However, since 1 million is equivalent to zero it awards them immediately at 1,010,000. -- or --

d) Being an 8-bit game, 255 ships is the maximum recognized. 256 ships/smart bombs is treated as zero. If you win exactly 256 ships during this period the machine will think you have won none and thus begin awarding ships immediately at 1,010,000.


* In either case, you get to keep your surplus ships and bombs and can have super long turns where you bomb 2 to 3 times per wave to get out of dangerous situations. It's possible on a real Defender machine to make the screen color inverted so that all the black space is white while you are playing. It will reset itself when you die and maybe by hyperspacing. Smartbomb flashes are cool when it's reversed. The trick, as I remember it, was to drop a credit in right when you die and the screen flashes white. Somehow the program gets distracted (non masked interrupt on coin drop?) and it the screen stays white.

Fearsome Unknown Creatures Close In. Now, A New Terror Spreads Out Across The Universe !! The player moves his spaceship to the right and left with the control lever and fires missiles by pressing the Fire button. When the space demons are attacked they change their shapes and fire missiles. The player must avoid their attacks and retaliate with his own missiles. When all the small demons have been shot down and the super-demon is hit in the heart, the screen is cleared.


- TRIVIA -


This game is a rare prototype.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hint 1 - The Small Demons Change Their Shapes Three Times: The first demon shape (Demoneye-jr: 40 pts) turns into the second (Octoplus: 70 pts) and the second into the third (Octobomb: 100 pts) when they are shot. Care must be taken to prevent Octobomb ramming into the spaceship.


* Hint 2 - Bonus Chance for 3-Demon Formation: Sometimes Demoneye-jr and Octoplus change their color. If Octoplus are shot while their color is changing they will turn into a group of three Octobombs. If all these three demons are killed a bonus point is scored.


* Hint 3 - Aim At The Heart Of he Super-Demon: When all the small demons have been wiped out, a hole appears beneath the body of the Super-Demon (Demoneye X: 500 pts). This is the Super-Demon's weak point. If the player can shoot the Super-Demon in the heart he can destroy the creature.


* Hint 4 - 3-Eyes Demon King Appears: If the player succeds in a series of two games, a three-eyed demon king appears (Demoneye-King: 1500 pts). To destroy it, the player must hit its heart 3 times with his missiles.

Introduced in 1982, Dig Dug was a shining addition to the golden age of video games. Dig Dug's charming world and innovative game play made it an instant classic.


* A place in video game history: During the golden age of video games we saw a lot of novel approaches to gaming, said Chris Lindsey, director of the National Video Game and Coin-Op Museum in St. Louis. "Tempest", for instance, required things of its players that we'd never seen in a video game before. You had to learn a whole new set of skills to further the game experience. Dig Dug is another game that provided a novel approach. The types of movement you had to learn, the skills you had to develop, were like none other up until that point. And this game play was combined with a really engaging subject matter, which was this guy, Dig Dug, who digs around underground after subterranean monsters, and who explodes them with a really bizarre weapon, an air pump! There was just this string of interesting, engaging things for the viewer to look at and experience while dealing with this new type of game. It really captured, and still captures, the imagination. The sounds in Dig Dug are also really distinctive. When people hear that music start to play here at the museum, they'll laugh with recognition. It's quite funny watching people play that game.


* The great 25-cent escape: Lindsey enjoys seeing visitors to his museum discover a video game that rekindles memories from earlier years.

"They'll say, 'Wow, I used to be great at this!' And then they'll adopt their old game-playing position -- which seems to vary almost randomly from person to person," Lindsey said. "They drop a token in, start rolling, and then they will lose all sense of time and space, becoming completely immersed in the game. Often they'll start laughing. I had a guy yesterday who was so funny. He came in and had obviously played these video games quite a bit in years past, like many of us did. He wandered around the museum, going from game to game, and he just laughed hysterically as he remembered all the little details of each game that he had spent so much time on, so long ago."


* Namco notes After the release of Dig Dug in 1982, Namco engineers went to arcades to watch their new game being played. They noticed that "there were two completely separate groups of people. One group enjoyed blowing the enemy up with the pump. The other group enjoyed beating the enemy by dropping rocks on them".


Dig Dug was NOT the first game that Atari licensed from Namco, as is common belief. That honor goes to F-1, the '3D' racing game that projected a race track on a screen using a rolling film. Nobody in Atari coin-op liked Dig Dug except for Brian McGhie, now with Starpath. It was McGhie who added the finishing touches to Dig Dug.


A Dig Dug unit appears in 1983 min movie 'WarGames'.


Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Video Game Music - YLC-20003) on 25/04/1984.

Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The Best Of Video Game Music - 32XA-66) on 25/04/1986.


In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including: "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".


- UPDATES -


The background graphics are slightly different in the Atari version, the earth is less regular.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Easter Egg:

1) Enter service mode.

2) Keep B1 pressed and enter the following sequence: Up(x6), Right(x3), Down(x4), Left(x8).

3) '(c) 1982 NAMCO LTD.' will appear on the screen.


* Dig Dug Bug: Get either a Pooka or Fygar right on your tail, then pump him up but not so much that he explodes. Do this right near a rock--be warned that this is rather tricky. The idea is to loosen the rock when the enemy is almost fully inflated, get out of the way, then do a quick reverse and finish off the enemy at exactly the same time as he is crushed by the rock (avoiding the rock yourself, of course). This will confuse the game and all enemies on the current level will disappear leaving you to aimlessly dig tunnels through the dirt. You will not progress to the next level until you drop another rock.


* Hint: If you want to be extra greedy and get more points, eat all the dirt on the level. Leave only two enemies (because they will speed up, and three is too hard to handle). You don't need to eat every little bit of dirt (you can leave long passageways to slow down the enemies). Also leave only pookas, since the fygars can burn you through the dirt.

Donkey Kong (c) 07/1981 Nintendo.


How high can you get? Donkey Kong has kidnapped Mario's girlfriend! In this action-packed rescue adventure, you move Mario the carpenter through incredible dangers to save her.


- TRIVIA -


Donkey Kong was the first multi-playfield game. Was a quick replacement for an excess stock of cabinets for a poor game called "Radarscope".


Note: Mario isn't 'Mario' just yet; Donkey Kong features the hero 'Jumpman'. Mario received his final name just in time for "Donkey Kong Jr".


Donkey Kong inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Do The Donkey Kong' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album.


A Donkey Kong unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', in the 1984 movie 'Gremlins' and in the 1985 movie 'The Heavenly Kid'.


MB (Milton Bradley) released a boardgame based on this video game (same name) in 1982: Save the girl and avoid the barrels as the video game.


- UPDATES -


The Japanese version have the board in the logical order 1-2-3-4, while in the US version they changed it to 1-4-1-3-4-1-2-3-4.


In the older versions of the game you can stay at the top of a ladder and a barrel will never come down the ladder to hit you. They later changed it so that a barrel comes down most of the time.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Point Trick: In the 'rivet/girder' stage, when you make Donkey Kong fall, stand right next to Donkey Kong and jump. Each jump yields 100 points. However, the timer is going down faster, so there is really no advantage to this method, as your point bonus is going down faster than your score is.


* Fireball Escape: In the 'rivet' stage, if you are standing at the edge of the screen and are about to be hit by a fireball, jump off the edge of the screen. You will get bounced back by the invisible border, and land back on the platform. If you were lucky, the fireball may have moved away.


* A Trick (This trick works only with the Japanese version of Donkey Kong): On the 'barrel' levels, you can stay on a ladder without worrying about the barrels coming down and hitting you. Just make sure that Mario's hand is touching the top of the girder (so that it looks like the barrels are rolling over his hand). As long as you're in this position, no barrel will ever come down your ladder.

Save Your Papa! "Donkey Kong" is back. Only this time the vengeful Mario is holding DK prisoner. Luckily DK has a son, Junior, who will try to rescue Papa. To free his dad, Junior must make his way through a dark and treacherous jungle. Racing against time, the little fellow climbs and swings from vines, while avoiding the horrible Snap jaws.


- TRIVIA -


This game is also known as "Donkey Kong Junior".


The song that is played before the play is Bach's 'Toccata and Fugue in D Minor'.

The Donkey Kong Jr. boards (Japan & "Moon Cresta" Hardware) allow you to enter a name up to twelve letters.

The Donkey Kong Junior boards (US) only allow you up to three letters.


On the bootleg version, the name on highscore table are different.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Slow Down: This trick is not really usefull but it has a comical effect. On the first level, climb to the top of the two vines at the far right edge of the screen. Then, with one hand on each vine, push up against the top of the screen and hold the joystick forward. All of the action on the screen will slow to snails pace until you release the joystick.


* Infinite Play: This trick allows player 1 to earn an infinite number of extra turns, at the expense of player 2's game. Player 1 just plays a normal game but each time player 2 has a turn he must perform a trick that costs him that turn and earns each player an extra turn. If player 2 can do the trick every time, player 1 will always have extra turns to play with and player 2 will always have at least one turn left to perform the trick the next time around. At the beginning of the first level, Junior appears on a platform in the lower left corner of the screen, as shown above. Walk to the right edge of this platform, and move as far right as possible without falling off. Only Junior's heel should still be on the platform. Wait at the edge of the platform and watch for a blue Snapjaw to come down the first vine to the right. As soon as the Snapjaw leaves the end of the vine to fall in the water, jump toward him. You should hit the Snap jaw at the same time it hits the water. If you timed your jump correctly, your turn will be over but both players will be awarded an extra turn. You can then play normally (as player 1) until player 2's turn comes up again and you must repeat the trick.

Game ID: TA-0021


The defining beat-'em-up, featuring Billy and Jimmy Lee as they beat through gang members in order to save Marion from the machinegun-toting Shadow Boss!

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and three buttons.


- TRIVIA -


Licensed to Taito for manufacture and distribution in America and Europe (07/1987).


One of the most infamous arcade titles of the mid-1980's, Double Dragon popularized a new genre of action games known as the 'side-scrolling beat-em up'. The game was such a huge hit, that when the home version finally came out, the game box advertised, 'You'll never have to stand in line to play Double Dragon again!'


The character names are loosely derived from the Bruce Lee film, 'Enter the Dragon'.


On Stage 1, on the wall, above the second ladder of the stage, is a red billboard that says 'Kunio-kun' with a man in white. This is a reference to a character from Technos' Kunio-kun franchise games such as "Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun" (US "Renegade"), "Nekketsu Koukou Dodgeball-bu" (US "Super Dodge Ball") and the NES classic "Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari" (US "River City Ransom").


Apollon Music released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Original Sound of Double Dragon - KHY1026) in cassette format on 02/1988.


A Double Dragon unit appears in the 1994 movie 'Double Dragon'.


Tiger Electronics released a boardgame based on this video game (same name) in 1989: The winner is the first player to successfully fight his or her way around the game board to Jimmy's Hideout to rescue Marian. You will pass through the slum section, the industrial section, the forest section and the hideout section on the rocky road to victory.


- UPDATES -


The original Japanese version by Technos has a different storyline than the one used by Taito in the international version.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Here's How To Get Infinite Points iIn Double Dragon: Level One, one player grabs the whip when it comes out. The other player relieves the enemy who walks out with a bat of that bat. But he does NOT kill said enemy. Continue moving on until you're at the end of stage one. At this point the player WITHOUT the whip grabs the now batless enemy. The other player finishes the stage. Note that when the boss man is dead, the clock stops running down. Then the player tortures the batless one with the whip. 200 points per pop, and the enemy will NEVER die. Switch to non-whip attack to kill him, and resume normal play.


* To easily get through the whole game, use the following strategy. When an opponent is coming towards you from one direction, face the opposite direction. When the enemy is at arm's length, do an elbow smash. The enemy will go flying forward. While the opponent is still on the ground, face away from him/her and repeat the process. Now, you can defeat enemies without them attacking. This strategy also works for bosses.


* Ghost Player: Notice that player one gets all the points for certain weapons. Notably the barrel, which is important because it is reusable. Should player one die, while player two is still alive, player one continues to get points for the barrel. If this gets him over the extra-man mark, he gets a ghost player, which is limited in the kinds of things he can do.


* At the end of some levels you can throw your weapons onto the next stage. Normally you discard them, but you can cheat. This works well on level 1, for instance. When at the end of the level, just after you kill the boss, move to the extreme right of the level, as far as it will scroll. Jump up just as the level ends and scrolls to the next one, if you time it right you will let go of your weapon in mid air and it will fall onto the next stage where you can just about pick it up at the very left of the screen!

Ten Double Dragon alumni, including the inflatable Abobo, do battle with each other to earn the right to face Shuko, the end boss. Lots of things to destroy in the background!


- TRIVIA -


Double Dragon was Techno's first game for the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware. This game was based on the movie 'Double Dragon', which was, in turn, based on the 'Double Dragon series' of games.


The game features a combo counter like many fighting games, however this one is not always very accurate since it registers Cheng Fu's multi-hit rush combo super move (Forward Dragon Punch motion + two buttons) as a single hit! :P. The original Double Dragon title can be seen in the large white boat on Cheng Fu's stage!


The weirdest fact about this game is that some characters have changed WAY too much from their original concepts, this applies to two characters in particular: One of these is Marian (the famed damsel in distress in the series) is now one of the deadliest fighters in the game; the other one being Duke, the original game's final boss has apparently decided to play fair by ditching the machine gun & his beard and has become quite a powerful martial artist (not to mention that he looks a lot younger in this game).


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Play As Duke / As King Shuko: Go to the character selection screen and put the cursor on Billy, then Marian, then Chung Fu, then Jimmy for *3* seconds each. If done correctly you will hear the word hear 'Bingo!'.


* Alternate Costume Colors: Press B, C or D when selecting a fighter.

So they embark on a world quest to meet up with new allies & to claim the Rosseta Stones from the meanest fighters ever, in order to meet up with this new enemy in this strange chapter in the Double Dragon saga.

The game features some unique extras that are quite rare in similar games of the beat-em up genre: Backup Fighters: In the stores is possible to recruit new fighters with different fighting styles to aid the Lee brothers. Stores do not accept virtual money, so you must insert coins to purchase goodies! (Great idea or ultimate ripoff? You decide...)

Dragon's Lair (c) 06/1983 Cinematronics.


The player controls the action of Dirk the Daring on his quest through an enchanted castle. Quick reflexes and clear thinking are vital for Dirk's survival. Features sumptuous animation and stunted gameplay.


- TRIVIA -


Licensed to Atari for European distribution and to Sidam for Italian distribution.


Dragon's Lair was one of the first game to uses of the then-new Laserdisc format. It was the first game to have feature-quality animation (exactly 22 minutes of full animation at a cost of 1.3 million dollars). This set it apart from the other arcade games of the day which had very primitive graphics.


The animation was done by Don Bluth Studios, which also did feature-length animated movies such as 'The Secret of NIMH' and 'An American Tail'. Don Bluth was a former Disney employee who left to start his own company. To keep the cost as low as possible, they decided not to hire professional voice actors. Instead they all pitched in and did the voices themselves. Sound Engineer, Dan Molina was the voice of Dirk the Daring. Vera Lanpher, head of assistant animators, was the voice of Daphne. The narrator was Michael Rye and the musical score was created by Christopher Stone.


Dragon's Lair had a huge impact on the arcade industry in 1983 (grossing more than 32 million dollars in the first eight months in the arcades). It was so big that quite a bit of merchandise was produced. Dragon's Lair books, buttons, trading cards, stickers and toys were just a few of the many different items that could be purchased.


Marvel Studio produced a Saturday-morning TV-show based on the game. The TV show, produced by Ruby Spears, debuted in the fall of 1984 on ABC and lasted only 1 season.


There was also a Dragon's Lair feature film that was planned, storyboarded, and written but never put into production. The film was to be called 'Dragon's Lair - The Legend'.

You will now have unlimited lives until you complete the game.

- UPDATES -


REVISION 1:

* Software version: '960209' ('960206' for the Japanese release).


REVISION 2:

* Software version: '960619'.

* Name BUG corrected (see 'Tips And Tricks' section for more info).


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* BUG: Very beneficial trick in some cases but leads to lockups. Chose a character with a 6-character name (Blue Dwarf and possibly 2 others). Press the name button and then erase it and start pressing buttons to put your own letters in. The timer to enter your name will reset as long as you are pressing buttons to enter letters. What happens is that you can continue to enter more letters than the code expects and you begin to over-write the area of memory that contains character information and inventory. Depending on what letters you enter and how many you enter you can continue the game at the beginning of the next stage and already be hasted, invulnerable, invisible, possessing powerful weapons, etc... The character info on screen is all garbled. Once you make it to the first shop you can drag apparently empty inventory items into the trash for large sums of silver. The game will lock up quite frequently though - especially when you pick up items that hold specific places in memory. Try using about 110 'M's for a name. This glitch was removed with the later revision.

Egg Venture (c) 1997 The Game Room.


- TRIVIA -


Egg Venture was a joint project between arcade parts company 'The Game Room' and 'ICE' (Innovative Creations in Entertainment), each of whom released their own version. The game was programmed by Kyle Hodgetts and does have several minor glitches, mainly down to the bizarre hardware choice. An example of this Egg Venture is the fact that Kyle is forced to duplicate the sound system three times on the board to achieve polyphony, rather than using a YM/OKI combination. 


Egg Venture does not have an ending and it's only scoring system is the printing of the Dynamic Play Adjustment skill ranking after every 'day'.


The game uses (in places) the bass line from 'The Great Egg Race' by Martin Cooke and Richard Denton of BBC Records, although this is apparently a legitimate use.


Following the success of Egg Venture, or more likely to fix the bugs present, a 'Deluxe version' was made.


The Egg Venture characters were later used in a kids redemption game.


- UPDATES -


The deluxe version has an ending, when you complete the tour, but the Dynamic Play Adjustment has a serious bug. The game encodes the number of successful completions and uses this to alter the difficulty. However, the number seems to decrease rather than increase at first, giving a difficulty multiplier of -1 after a few rounds. This makes the following level (Factory Eggs) incredibly difficult until you lose a couple of lives.

As a secret agent, you must infiltrate buildings in order to snag secret documents and make your escape before the goons in black suits get the best of you! Simple yet fun gameplay make this an easy to pick up game for lots of fun!


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the Taito SJ System hardware.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* If you've got a man in black on the floor below as you come down in the elevator, jump towards him when you're about halfway down to his floor. You'll jump straight up against the floor above and then move forward into the bad guy as you come down, either killing him or giving you enough time to duck and shoot.


* Shoot all the time, especially when you get at the hard levels. When you are waiting for an elevator, shoot constantly in the opposite direction. That way, you will instantly hit an eventual enemy (instead of figuring out how to deal with him AND the guys arriving with the elevator).


* At the end of each level, if you get two red doors at opposite sides of the building, go down to the basement and teleport yourself back, instead of jumping back and forth.

*  If you manage to shoot all the first few screens worth of enemies (which is much easier with two players) you get rewarded with a group of dragonflies moving across the top. Each dragonfly is worth 10,000 points.


* Watch out for WOPs, which are POWs in reverse. They reduce your power level.


* There are special POWs that turn enemies into fruit. They're not the pretty POW on a circular background - those give power-ups - these are just the word POW. If you find one of these, hold off on using it until you get several of the bigger enemies onscreen. They're worth 5,000 points in their fruit form.

Take off on a fantastic video trip. A voyage that simulates the thrills and skilles of actual Hang Gliding. Players use the joystick to control Freddie, but good timing and strategy is necessary to successfully negotiate invisible air currents, wind direction and up and down drafts. This game has incredible visual impact for this time, Freedie fliers the skies over the Alps--over trains, trees, bridges, through winter and summer seasons; over the Pacific--over a yacht, tropical islands, an aircraft carrier; and over Egypts--camels, Pyramids, the Taj Mahal, the Sphinx, through day and night landscapes. It's a complete global challenge with non-stop action over a continuously changing panorama below.

Fatal Fury - King of Fighters (c) 11/1991 SNK.

Game ID: 0033


Terry Bogard & Andy Bogard enter in a tournament called the King of Fighters where they must face dangerous fighters in order to find their father's murderer, none other than the tournament's sponsor & supreme champion: Geese Howard. Joe Higashi also enters the tournament in search of the championship title. Who will come out victorious? The main features in this story-driven fighter are backgrounds that feature 2 battle planes for pseudo 3-D action, & excellent music!

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and three buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game is known in Japan as "Garou Densetsu - Shukumei no Tatakai" (translates from Japanese as 'Legend of Hungry Wolf - Battle of Destiny').


This game runs on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware.


Originally called 'Real Bout', SNK opted to change the title to 'Fatal Fury'.


The official name of the tournament is 'The King of Fighters'. This can be verified if you look closely the promo poster seen in the name rankings. Later SNK would use this name for a popular game series of its own.


The music in a 2-player battle is taken from the first stage of "Street Smart".


This is the very first game that featured one of SNK's most famous fighters: Terry Bogard! Over the years, Terry Bogard has appeared in many games, usually in his familiar jacket with a star on his back and a cap on his head. However, what is on his cap is different (probably because he tosses so many of them, but that's a different story). Some games have him wear a blank cap, some have his cap say 'Running Wild', some have the Neo-Geo logo on them, but the commonly accepted cap is the one that says 'Fatal Fury' on it.


Terry Bogars appears in "Quiz King of Fighters" as selectable character.


This game was such a hit in Japan that an animated movie was released featuring character designs by Masami Ohbari. This movie's plot is fairly true to the game's main plot and all the characters in the game are featured. The movie was released on the USA by coutesy of Viz Video, a division of Viz Comics.


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Garou Densetsu, Last Resort - PCCB-00087) on 21/05/1992.


- UPDATES -


The Japanese version features quite different movelist sets for the three main characters (In the Fatal Fury sequels as well as the King of Fighters, Terry, Andy & Joe's movelist sets are clearly based on the japanese release of this particular game). All other versions feature very simplified joystick commands for each move.

Fatal Fury 2 (c) 12/1992 SNK.

Game ID: 0047


The lone wolves are back once again and they will battle the world's strongest fighters. However a mysterious & powerful new enemy is looking for them, the ones who defeated Geese Howard. Can the lone wolves face this new threat and come out victorious. Features background with 2 different background planes, improved control & some very nice music! :)

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and four buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game is known in Japan as "Garou Densetsu 2 - Arata-Naru Tatakai" (translates from Japanese as 'Legend of Hungry Wolf 2 - The New Battle').


This game runs on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware.


Things that changed in this sequel:

* This game allows you to switch between the background & foreground planes at will (in the first game, you could only switch planes if the CPU was on a different battle plane!).

* The game ditches the previous game's 3 button setup (punch, kick & throw) in favor of a new 4 button setup (light & heavy punches & kicks). This is apparently one of the very first Neo Geo fighters to use this now common button setup.

* This game introduces the use of Desperation Moves (highly damaging techniques that can only be used whe the lifebar is flashing red). This game as well as "Art of Fighting" were the first fighting games to introduce these moves.

* Newcomers in the game are: Mai Shiranui, Cheng Sinzan, Kim Kaphwan, Jubei Yamada, Big Bear (aka Raiden), Axel Hawk, Lawrence Blood & Wolfgang Krauser. Richard Meyer, Michael Max, Tung Fu Rue, Duck King, Hwa Jai & Geese Howard were left out! (although some of them make some cameos during some of the game's cutscenes!).


Just as the first game introduced the famed Terry Bogard, this game features SNK's most popular fighter lady: Mai Shiranui! :). Mai appears in "Quiz King of Fighters" as selectable character.


The Hungry Wolf is a reference to Terry Bogard, the main character in Fatal Fury. Terry, Andy and Joe (and to a lesser extent, Mai and Mary) are referred to as the Lone Wolves.


Keeping the tradition of the first game, an animated movie based on this game was released in Japan featuring character designs by Masami Ohbari. The movie was also released in the USA by Viz Video, a division of Viz Comics. After the second Fatal Fury movie was released, a third movie followed (which predated "Fatal Fury 3 - Road to the Final Victory"). It follows the adventures of the Lonely Wolves (Terry, Andy, Joe and Mai) as they attempt to prevent a power-hungry man from claiming all the parts of the legendary Armor of Mars.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* You can only see any character's ending if you beat the game with a single credit used (No continues or two player matches are allowed!) :/.

Fatal Fury 3 - Road to the Final Victory (c) 03/1995 SNK.

Game ID: 0069


During a trip to Southtown to attend the inauguration of a new branch of Pao Pao Cafe by former street fighter Richard Meyer, the lone wolves (Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard, Joe Higashi & Mai Shiranui) are unwillingly caught in the middle of a desperate search for the Shiranui Scrolls and the mysterious fighters that are after them! The game features a new graphic style, two different background planes to fight, a grade system that shows how well you perform in battle, lots of hidden moves & combos, as well as multiple endings based on your performance. The answers shall only be uncovered by a long & fierce battle, are you up to it?

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and four buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game is known in Japan as "Garou Densetsu 3 - Haruka-Naru Tatakai" (translates from Japanese as 'Legend of Hungry Wolf 3 - The Distant Battle').


This game runs on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware.


Things that changed in this particular game:

* The game introduces a deeper plane change system wich proved to be somewhat clunky & difficult to use due to the tricky commands used to move between planes.

* Chain combos are introduced to add even more depth to each character's fighting style. 

* Throws are harder to use since these are slow and throw-miss animations were added.

* Newcomers in the game are Bob Wilson, Blue Mary, Franco Bash, Hon Fu, Sokaku Mochizuki, Ryuji Yamazaki, Jin Chonshu & Jin Chonrei.


Hon Fu's goofy martial artist routine & easygoing personality make him SNK's hillarious homage to Jackie Chan. Definitely not a Bruce Lee clone! :)


Kyo Kusanagi & Sie Kensou make a cameo in Pao Pao Cafe!


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


One of the coolest things of this game is the fact that you can alter some backgrounds objects by slamming opponents against them. For example, you can knock away the training dummy in Joe's stage if you send an opponent flying towards it. Experiment on various stages to find more surprises!


Endings are based on your performance on the game, here are the final bosses you'll face according to how well you do:

1) Poor performance ending boss: Ryuji Yamazaki

2) Average performance ending boss: Jin Chonshu

3) Above average performance ending boss: Jin Chonshu (Jin Chonrei makes a brief cameo at the very end)

4) Good performance ending boss: Jin Chonrei


Note: If the game is set on the USA, ASIA or EUROPE bios, the game will reset after defeating Jin Chonrei and you won't get to see the ending, however if the game is set on the JAPAN bios it will work just fine! :)

Final Fight (c) 12/1989 Capcom.


After "Double Dragon", Final Fight became the benchmark of the beat-'em-up genre, with a nice variety of characters, large sprites and detailed backgrounds. A true classic of the genre!

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and two buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game was originally billed as the sequel to "Street Fighter" called 'Street Fighter '89'. While the game had become a major hit in its own right, Capcom decided to change the name to 'Final Fight' and save the "Street Fighter" name for another game, two years later.


This game runs on the Capcom Play System hardware (CPS).


The enemy character Andore and all his clones (Andore Jr., U. Andore, F. Andore and G. Andore) are Capcom's homage to the now late WWF Champion, Andre Rene Roussimoff aka 'Andre the Giant'.

Other characters such as Axl and Slash are parodies as well, being from the band 'Guns N' Roses'.

Poison is taken from the homonymous glam group of eighties in which the singer used to have a similar hat to the bitch in the game.

Abigail is an album of Mercyful Fate, whose singer (King Diamond) resembles the character in the game.

Final Fight Revenge (c) 1999 Capcom.


- TRIVIA -


This game was created by Capcom USA, not the main Japanese branch.


This game was a disappointment to many fans of the original "Final Fight", the original was a 2D side-scrolling beat-em' up, 'Revenge' is a 3-D versus fighting game, like "Street Fighter EX", only not as good.


This game runs on the Sega Titan Video hardware (STV).


If you are using Cody and defeat your opponent with the 'Punch-out' super move, you get a special 'You're already dead' victory pose that is a direct rip-off of 'Hokuto no Ken' (aka 'Fist of the North Star').

In 1990, Philip Morris, the tobacco conglomerate, filed a lawsuit claiming copyright infringement against Namco because this game featured a Marlboro billboard, which was found on the real-life Suzuka and Monaco tracks. Philip Morris was under investigation at the time for their role in preteen smoking and the appearance of one of their brands in games aimed towards children and teens did not help their image. Namco was forced to pay a settlement.

Fit of Fighting is a very horrible Art of Fighting bootleg:

* FM music.

* No damage in the fighters faces.

* No zooms.

* Poor IA.

* Poor gameplay (you have to execute the special attacks very slowly to get them running!).

* Ripped graphics but reprogrammed from 0.

The object of the game is for the player to maneuver his white orobt in 1 of 4 directions within a maze, capture a red character robot as they move about the maze, and race to the center to change the 9 white balls located there to red. The player may only change one white ball to red at a time after he has captured a red robot, and must evade 4 chaser monsters in the process. Bonus point may be earned when capturing the elusive 'red king' that appears on the screen. Capture him and momentarily immobilize the chasers, but do not come in contact with the yellow robots--or your much-needed red robots will be change to white and force you to change strategy. Play is over when the chasr have captured all of the player's robots. But, should the player be successful in changing all of the balls in the center to red, the pattern clears and a different challenge is presented. A 3x3 or 4x4 tri-colored pattern will appear at bottom screen and a slightly different tri-colored cube of corresponding size will appear at center screen. The player may earn bonus points by moving the directional arrow and rearranging the colors of the cube at center screen to match the sample pattern presented at the bottom of the screen. The player is given 90 seconds to rearrange the cube as many times as he can. Action returns to the maze whether you win or lose the cube challenge. All in all, an excting and challenging game where patience and skill are required.

Take off on a fantastic video trip. A voyage that simulates the thrills and skilles of actual Hang Gliding. Players use the joystick to control Freddie, but good timing and strategy is necessary to successfully negotiate invisible air currents, wind direction and up and down drafts. This game has incredible visual impact for this time, Freedie fliers the skies over the Alps--over trains, trees, bridges, through winter and summer seasons; over the Pacific--over a yacht, tropical islands, an aircraft carrier; and over Egypts--camels, Pyramids, the Taj Mahal, the Sphinx, through day and night landscapes. It's a complete global challenge with non-stop action over a continuously changing panorama below.

Food Fight (c) 1982 Atari.

Game ID: 136020


The player, as Charley Chuck, must dodge all kinds of flying fruit and vegerables and try to eat an ice cream cone before it melts. How many ice cream cones can he eat? Your players will soon find out in this incredible video feast. As an ice cream cone melts on the others side of the screen, Charley Chuck just naturally has to go for it, But he must get past Oscar, Angelo, Jacques and Zorba, four chefs who unexpectedly pop out of holes, chase Charley Chuck and throw food at him. They all have different personalities and they're all out to stop Charley Chuck if he isn't fast enough. There are piles of tomatoes, peas, bananas, pies and watermelon Charley Chuck can use to defend himself from the persistent chefs.

The player controls Charley Chuck with an analog joystick wich allow 360° movement on the playfield, and a Throw button, used when Charley Chuck needs to throw food at one of the chefs.


- TRIVIA -


Food Fight was designed for Atari by General Computing as part of a lawsuit settlement for an illegal speedup kit for "Missile Command", in which they affixed their copyright. This was one of two games; "Quantum" was the other. Inspired by the food fight scene in National Lampoon's Animal House.


The game code shares a hidden message: HI JON.


Approximately 2,050 units were produced (only ~100 cocktail).


A Food Fight unit appears in the 1985 movie 'Real Genius'.


In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including: "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".

In the future, a powerful enemy force has seized an inhabited planet now known as the Dust World and it is up to two unknown soldiers to try to obliterate the invaders and restore their planet's former name: 'Earth'. Features excellent graphics with awesome enemy designs, LOTS of weapons to buy and a solid challenge!

This game is known in Japan as "Lost Worlds".


This game runs on the Capcom Play System hardware (CPS).


Forgotten Worlds is NOT the sequel to "Black Tiger" but he shares several similitudes with it: In both games the player must fight dragons, collect 'ZENNY' money and buy weapons and armour in shops. Also, both games have intros depicting dragons attacking cities.


The first player character, Unknown Soldier, appears as an assist character in "Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes". The second player character would appear in "Final Fight" as an enemy member of Mad Gear. He was then called 'Two P' (for 2P, 'player 2').

Frogger (c) 06/1981 Konami.

Game ID: GX392


Home may look like it's only a hop, skip and a jump away, but looks can be deceiving. First, there's a dangerous highway to hop across, full of fast-moving cars and trucks. Then there's a swirling river to leap, full of frog-eating creatures.


- TRIVIA -


Licensed to Sega for US distribution (10/1981).


A bootleg of this game is known as "Frog".


Frogger achieves dramatic success after its summer 1981 release in Japan and early 1982 release in the States, where Sega capitalizes on the product.


The sound made when you insert a coin in Frogger was sampled by producer Richard X for the Sugababes' song 'Freak Like Me' (and is the very first sound on the track).


Frogger inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Froggy's Lament' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album.


A Frogger unit appears in the 1999 movie 'Magnolia'.


An episode of Seinfeld (a classic TV show) had a parody of the game - an overhead shot of a man attempting to wheel a Frogger arcade cabinet across a busy street. The scene ended with the cabinet being smashed apart by a truck - quite traumatic to watch.


MB (Milton Bradley) released the same year a boardgame based on this video game (same name): In this version of the game, 2 players face off, each with their own army of frogs, logs, and automobiles. Each turn, a player spends his movement points either moving his frogs toward their goal (the other side of the board), or moving logs and cars in an attempt to block or squash the other player's frogs. Complete with "bonus points" for landing on flies, this is actually a pretty faithful interpretation of the video-game; but far too simple to have any long-lasting interest. More of a curiosity for video game enthusiasts than anything.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* This isn't a cheat or an easter egg - it's just an interesting quirk: Watch the Frogger demo, and when the frog gets to the last log, the player has control over him for the very last move. You can verify this by jumping backwards rather than forwards!

When the DIP switch is set to English, the Japanese subtitle written in kanji underneath the title reads 'Seisensha'. This could be translated (rather clumsily) to 'Journeying Soldier' or (to the better sounding) 'Crusader' for this partiuclar instance, since there is a religious overtone in the prologue of the game, even though the Japanese word 'Seisensha' is as secular as the word 'chair' and doesn't contain a underlying religious meaning such as with the case of the word 'Crusader'.

When the DIP switch is set to Japanese, the Japanese subtitle is just the title of the game written in katakana, which is read as 'Gaia Kuruseidaazu'.

Galaga (c) 09/1981 Namco.


- TRIVIA -


Licensed to Bally Midway for US manufacture and distribution (12/1981).


A bootleg of this game is known as "Gallag".

A hack of this game is called "Gatsbee".


Although Galaga was a superior game, it didn't sell the large numbers that its predecessor did. One of the first games with a bonus stage.


The game 'rolls over' at 999,990 points. The player 1 score counter is six digits, but the player 2 counter is seven digits. Therefore, most good players start a 2 players game and play exclusively on the player 2 side so their score won't 'roll over' at 999,990. After the 1,000,000 mark, new ships are no longer awarded.


The game 'rolls over' after stage 255. After finishing the 255th level, the screen says 'Stage 0' and the machine locks up.


If you have more than 7 extra men, the marker for the screen will only show 7 1/2 (!) men remaining. Additional extra men will still be credited, even though they won't show on the screen.


A Galaga unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', in the 1984 movie 'The Karate Kid' and in the 1987 movie 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles'.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Easter Egg:

1) Enter service mode.

2) Keep B1 pressed and enter the following sequence: Right(x5), Left(x6), Right(x3), Left(x7). '(c) 1981 NAMCO LTD.' will be added at the bottom of the screen.


* Enemy Stop Shooting: On the first stage, kill everything but the two bees in the bottom left corner. Then just wait, dodging the bees' shots, until the bee no longer drops any shots towards you. After the bees stop firing, let it pass for 2 more trips and then kill them. For the rest of the game, the enemies will not drop shots. It will take approximately 15 minutes for the bees to quit shooting at you, so this trick requires a lot of patience. Note: In a 2-player game, only one person has to do the cheat for both players to benefit. But as soon as 1 of the players game is over the bees begin shooting again.


* (BUG) Take The Control Of The Ship For Free: During the Galaga demo, the Galaga character comes down and tries to tractor-beam up the player's ship. As soon as that tractor-beam starts, the player can take control of the ship in the demo. The player has two choices here and this will effect how the game handles this bug: If the player allows himself to be captured, the demo will continue as normal and he has the option of controlling the player ship or not. The player can choose whether to save the captured ship, try to complete the level, etc. The demo mode will complete after 30 seconds and the high-score screen will appear. If the player takes control of the ship and destroys the Galaga with the tractor beam, some of the characters on the screen will freeze while others are still moving and doing what they are suppose to be doing. This will last 15-20 seconds, then the game will go to the high score screen.


* Challenging stages are easier if the high score numbers are used to refine your aim. These tips assume a 6-digit high score:

1) On the first 2 challenging stages, aim your ships so that your left set of bullets falls between the second and third numbers in the high score list.

2) On subsequent challenging stages, aim one set of your bullets between the first and second numbers in the high score list (if the units come from the left) or between the last and next-to-last numbers (if the units come from the right). This will allow you to hit descending enemies at the highest possible point.


* Here Is A neat (and useless) Galaga Trick: It is possible to end the game with a 200% ratio. The 200% hit-miss ratio trick can only be done with your first shot of the game. When the game starts, don't move, and fire only one shot. If you time it correctly, two enemies will be killed at once. Let your remaining ships be destroyed, and presto: a better-than-perfect result.

Galaga 3 (c) 10/1984 Namco.


- TRIVIA -


This game is known outside US as "Gaplus" (07/1984).


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Easter Egg:

1) Enter service mode.

2) Keep Start and Button 1 pressed, move joystick Left until sound reaches 19. '(c) 1984 NAMCO' will appear on the screen.


* These tips are all variations on the same theme:

1) On level 1, allow all of the enemies to appear and fly into formation without shooting any of them. After the boss alien appears (the one that carries the tractor beam attachment), you'll see a pulsar similar to the ones the aliens appear from fly from just above the boss alien to the middle-right of the screen. Once it's gone by, shoot only the second alien from the left in the bottom row of the formation. A 'Special' flag will appear just below where it was; pick it up and you'll get a bonus ship.

2) In Parsec 1, go up to the very front and wait for all the bugs to come out. Then kill the 2nd bug from the left in the bottom row to make the special flag appear. Now, when the boss is coming down, move your ship and kill yourself by touching it. Don't touch the blaster head, just the boss. Your ship is turned into the blue one, and go get the special flag.


* Another Approach To The Same Situation: At the start of the first round, push straight up until you stop. DON'T shoot! Just sit there and let all the bugs form. Right after the last row of bugs get into formation a star will shoot from the top left side of the screen to the bottom right. If you time this right you can get up to 5 shots on it. After about 10 hits on the star (it will come out at random times during the game) it will transform your ship into a new ship that can shoot 3 shots on the screen (3 shots verticaly in a row) instead of just 2.

Galaxian (c) 10/1979 Namco.


- TRIVIA -


Licensed to Midway for US manufacture and distribution (12/1979).

The Nichibutsu version is known as "Moon Alien".


Some hacks of this game are known as "Galaxian Part 4", "Galaxian Turbo", "Super Galaxians", "Super Invaders galactica", "Swarm" and "Galaxian Part X".

A Spanish bootleg made by Petaco S.A. is known as "Zero Time".


Space battles of all kinds played a major role during the golden age of video games. With the introduction of Galaxian in 1979, players were transported to the most colorful and challenging space battle yet.

This was the first video game released with 100 percent of its graphics displayed in true R.G.B. color.


A place in video game history: "Galaxian captivated the minds of quite a few arcade enthusiasts," said Chris Lindsey, director of the National Video Game and Coin-Op Museum in St. Louis. "It was a relatively early entry in the golden age of video games, and it capitalized on the enthusiasm created by the earlier video game classic, "Space Invaders", while providing a more colorful, njoyable, and demanding gaming experience.

Galaxian had smarter bad guys than "Space Invaders", and it demanded that the player really pay attention to what was going on. And there were no shields, like many games have today. You really had to stay on the ball. Galaxian also had great sound and used elements that have since become standard -- such as flags and other symbols to mark the player's progression through different levels of game play.".


* The great 25-cent escape: "Galaxian definitely gets an enthusiastic response," Lindsey said. "In fact, I deliberately position the game near the entrance of the museum. Often it's the first game people go to." Lindsey often sees parents trying to convey to their child the excitement of these great games. "It is funny for me when I see a father trying to explain a game to his kid. Junior really just wants to get on the game and figure it out, and Dad wants to do a demo. Dad starts instructing Junior while Junior is sort of looking around, wondering how he can get away. But Dad continues, busily explaining the nuances of the game, which he knows Junior can't get on the first play. This all shows the enthusiasm that a certain generation still has for these terrific games."

With or without a parent's help, Lindsey sees a younger generation embracing the classic arcade games. "Kids by themselves will actually do quite well on these games," Lindsey said. "I'm somewhat surprised when I see how good kids are at picking up games. I sort of think that because I'm older, I should be able to play better, and that's not always the case with video games. That's a lesson an entire generation has had to learn.".


* Namco notes: Galaxian was one of Namco's first video games, and engineers throughout the company were gathered into a special team. As the game neared completion, the engineers suspected they had created a good game because other Namco employees were extremely "excited and crazy about the game." Once Galaxian was released, they knew they had a winner because, as one Namco engineer reported, "People [at the arcades] piled their coins onto the game cabinets to keep playing, and those who were waiting were very irritated because their turn never came. There were huge lines of people around each machine.".


A Galaxian unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.


- UPDATES -


The only code difference between the original Namco version and the licensed Midway version is that the BONUS SHIP text is printed on a different line.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Shoot one of the yellow (topmost) ships when it first comes down. It causes everyone to stop firing for a few moments.

- TRIVIA -


This game was renamed for US as "Galaga 3" (10/1984).


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Easter Egg:

1) Enter service mode.

2) Keep Start and Button 1 pressed, move joystick Left until sound reaches 19. '(c) 1984 NAMCO' will appear on the screen.


* These tips are all variations on the same theme:

1) On level 1, allow all of the enemies to appear and fly into formation without shooting any of them. After the boss alien appears (the one that carries the tractor beam attachment), you'll see a pulsar similar to the ones the aliens appear from fly from just above the boss alien to the middle-right of the screen. Once it's gone by, shoot only the second alien from the left in the bottom row of the formation. A 'Special' flag will appear just below where it was; pick it up and you'll get a bonus ship.

2) In Parsec 1, go up to the very front and wait for all the bugs to come out. Then kill the 2nd bug from the left in the bottom row to make the special flag appear. Now, when the boss is coming down, move your ship and kill yourself by touching it. Don't touch the blaster head, just the boss. Your ship is turned into the blue one, and go get the special flag.


* Another Approach To The Same Situation: At the start of the first round, push straight up until you stop. DON'T shoot! Just sit there and let all the bugs form. Right after the last row of bugs get into formation a star will shoot from the top left side of the screen to the bottom right. If you time this right you can get up to 5 shots on it. After about 10 hits on the star (it will come out at random times during the game) it will transform your ship into a new ship that can shoot 3 shots on the screen (3 shots verticaly in a row) instead of just 2.

Garou - Mark of the Wolves (c) 11/1999 SNK.

Game ID: 0243


The ninth "Fatal Fury" episode brings us twelve characters and foregos the plane-switching style of its predecessors in favor of a standard single-plane background. Absolutely beautiful graphics and animation and one of SNK's last (and greatest) games.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and four buttons.


- TRIVIA -


'Garou' translates from Japanese as 'Hungry Wolf'. 'Mark of the Wolves' is a reference to the legacy left behind by Terry to a new generation of fighters - specifically, Rock Howard.


Garou pushes the capabilities of the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware to its limit, giving some of the best-looking graphics to date ­ some critics saying that there is life after all in the Neo-Geo hardware, which was past its prime when the game was released.


Hokutomaru's stage has quite a few references to the rest of the "Fatal Fury" series. To the extreme left of the stage is a billboard with a picture of the old style Terry Bogard. A portrait of Geese Howard and his lieutenants can be seen on another billboard (this is the same picture that is seen in the flyer for Real Bout Fatal Fury). There is also a picture of Andy Bogard and Mai Shiranui holding hands posing as a bank advertisement right above another picture of Alfred.


The sign that Khushnood Butt shows off in his victory pose is a Kyokugen Karate dojo sign.


The Rock Howard music stage contains a part of the original Robert Miles techno single.


SME released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Garou - Mark of the Wolves - SCDC-00006) on 21/01/2000.


- UPDATES -


The prototype version has a white background at the title screen instead a blue background on the final version. It has also a graphic bug on the Terry Bogard stage during the second round at the extreme right.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Random Fighter: Hold Start and press a Punch or Kick button at the character selection screen.


* Play As Grant: At the character select screen, highlight Dong Hwan, hold Start and press Up(x2) Down(x2), Up, Down.


* Play As Kain: At the character select screen, highlight Jae Hoon, hold Start and press Down(x2), Up(x2), Down, Up.


* Alternate Costume Colors: Each character has 4 colors, corresponding to each button.


* Secret Taunts: After defeating your oponnent, hold Left or Right and tap Start to use an hidden taunt. Every character has two secret taunts (these can ONLY be used after defeating an oponnent and before your character goes into his/her winning pose). Some of them, such as Hotaru's and Hokutomaru's are really cool! :)


* Survival Mode: Insert a coin, hold A+B+C+D and press Start. You will then play a Survival Mode (quite hard one too).


* Rock's Winpose: Rock will have a special winpose when he finishes the opponent with a Shine Knuckle and a different one when he finishes the opponent with either a Raging Storm or the Deadly Rave Neo.

Gauntlet (c) 12/1985 Atari Games.

Game ID: 136037


In this exploration/shooting game with RPG elements, one to four players choose a character and explore the depths of a multi-level dungeon; destroy monsters by shooting, fighting or using magic potions; and collect power-ups to last longer.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and two buttons.


- TRIVIA -


When Gauntlet was introduced, it was a major technological achievement in arcade game design (So much so, that this game has been on at least two nation-wide museum tours). In the mid-1980's, the popularity of pen-and-paper role-playing games such as 'Dungeons & Dragons' was at its height. Still hot from the success of "Marble Madness" and "Paperboy", Atari Games created a game to capitalize on the current craze. In fact, what they DID create was a game that had an ambience that extended much further than the confines of the cabinet, and made them a LOT of money.


Gauntlet was based on a computer game called 'Dandy' for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. Jack Palevich, the author of Dandy, planned to sue Atari for plagiarizing their design, but he got a 'free' Gauntlet machine from Atari Coinop. In return, he signed papers saying that he wouldn't try to sue them (He took the Gauntlet machine into work....).


One of the most acclaimed features of Gauntlet was the extensive speech used throughout the game. The speech was not only used for effect ('Elf has been eating all the food lately'), but also for instruction in the early levels ('Save potions for later use'). At the time, games with that level of synthesized speech were unheard of. The sheer amount of enemies (and in some cases, the monster generators made that amount seem endless) was another lauded feature. Last, but certainly not the least, was the fun factor of the game. Four people trying to coordinate their movements is anything but unentertaining, even today!


Approximately 8,000 units were produced.


Note: There were 20 officially released versions (see Updates section for detailed info), including six 2-players versions and various Spanish, German and Japanese versions. Counting 4-players English variants alone, there were seven releases with various bugfixes.


Note 2: The game contains exactly 212 sounds! (including digitized voices, effects and musics).


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (That's Atari Music Vol.II: G.S.M. Atari Games 2 - PCCB-00070) on 21/09/1991.

* Open Doors Without Keys: Wait about 30 seconds without doing anything and all locked doors will open automatically.


* All Walls Turn Into Exits Trick (work on Revision 6 and +): Wait about 2 minutes without doing anything and all walls turn into exits (The game designers had to include this because there are some levels which require you to pick up a key before you exit. If you are already filled up with keys, and the doors are all gone, then it would be IMPOSSIBLE for you to exit, and you would starve to death).


* Hint 1: To manipulate the point value of Death, shoot him. Death's point value takes the following progression: 1000-2000-1000-4000-1000-6000-1000-8000, and then back to start. His value keeps from the previous game.


* Hint 2: You can kill Death painlessly by teleporting on top of him.

Gauntlet II (c) 08/1986 Atari Games.

Game ID: 136043


Controlled with an 8-way joystick and two buttons.


- TRIVIA -


Gauntlet II did not have as successful a run in arcades as its predecessor, but it fared better than most Gauntlet clones (such as Data East's "Shackled" and Sega's "Alien Syndrome", among others).


Contest: Atari had some contest attached to Gauntlet II when the game first came out. If you follow the instructions, the game gives you before going into the secret room (The machine provides clues on how to enter the secret rooms whenever a hidden wall is shot away on any level), you would get a screen showing that you'd been awarded some extra points and also to enter your name. Then it would give you a 6-digit code to put onto a contest entry form. The first 500 entries won Gauntlet II T-shirts plus a chance of winning a $5000 savings bond. Machines can also be set (via dip switches) to suppress this screen, in which case you would get a screen saying '5000 points x coins = xxx' after doing the secret room. The contest ended in 1986, so it's almost funny to see the contest screen today.


Approximately 3,000 kits were produced.


Note: The game contains exactly 205 sounds! (including digitized voices, effects and musics), less than the first Gauntlet.


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (That's Atari Music Vol.II: G.S.M. Atari Games 2 - PCCB-00070) on 21/09/1991.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Secret Rooms: To get to a secret room, perform a secret trick on a level. Some of the secret tricks are:

1) Teleporting into the exit.

2) Pushing a movable wall into the exit

3) Keeping all the super shots

4) Not using invulnerability (this is almost always a good idea anyway)

5) Not touching a fake exit

6) Teleporting on top of Death and/or acid blobs

7) Not taking ANYTHING (the tick trick comes in handy here)


* The hints it gives to the secret room don't necessarily apply to your current level, just as on "Gauntlet". The secret trick usually doesn't work, but it is always same for any given board. You're allowed one secret trick for every 15 levels or so.


* You can kill the acid blobs! Just drop 2 potions in quick succession. This works regardless of your magic ability. It also puts the dragon back to sleep momentarily (You can also kill them with a teleporter. If there's a teleporter handy, that is).


* The '?' foods are NOT random. Grab a '?' food on health mod 20 = 7 (i.e. 27, 47, 67, etc). You'll get 200 health.


* Couple of strategy notes:

1) Reflective shots make the dragon easier

2) Invulnerability makes him very easy

3) Remember that when generators aren't on the screen, they don't generate monsters.

4) If you are playing two+ player you can kill almost all dragons with one player diverting his attention, or using an indirect attack. For example: you can find shootable walls or just stand in the right spot askew from the dragon. He will try to flame instead of fire-ball. If done correctly, you will be standing a wall away from him. Then your partner can go around and shoot flame head while the dragon is flaming away.

- UPDATES -


The Japanese versions, unlike all other versions, use a cross instead of a shield.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Turn Into A Frog: As soon as you become a duck, shoot a tombstone 15 times in a row and an angel character will appear. This angel will fire a bolt at you. Let it hit you and you'll become a frog.


* Frog Bug Trick: Wait until the timer reaches 0:01 and then have the magician turn you into a frog, if he turns you into a frog as the timer runs out, Arthur becomes distorted (sprite broken) and the timer becomes crazy. But you can continue the play like this. :)


* Levitating Monsters: At level 6 (just after having beaten the big red guardian), kill the 5 skulls, then climb up the ladder to wake up the 2 doglike monsters. Go down again and walk right until you're blocked by the wall. Then wait for the monsters to stand just over you (possibly at the rightmost possible point), shoot at this very moment and it happens that they jump and remain in mid-air. It's not easy to do that, but you can manage to have both jumping and stuck. After that, you can safely climb up the ladder and walk while the monsters are moving above you without touching you. Don't shoot again, or they may jump up and go to the upper platform.


* Boss Tricks:

1) Dragon Trick - You can pass the level four dragon by fleeing! Just walk until music changes to boss theme (if you can't hear that, the spot is where you have the last two flames on the left of the screen), then go to extreme left: if everything is okay, the music should stop and the flames freeze. Go to the door to collect the key.

2) Demon Trick - To make disappear the demon boss at end of level five, try running away from him as fast as you can! Reach the floor with the hole in it and jump through it. If you have correct timing, you will fall in the pit, avoiding the moving platforms, and eventually escape the boss. Ogre boss tricks - The ogre bosses tend to jump when you fire, even if not directly at them. This is very useful in level six,when you can avoid losing your armor by activating the ogres, then going down the ladder and firing while holding your man in the same position where he starts at the beginning of the level.


* Other Tricks:

1) Weapon Trick - After having defeated a level boss(es),the knight can fire two or three "invisible shots"; if the man is facing the right border of the screen while doing so,the shots will reappear in the following stage. This can be exploited to kill some of the skulls at beginning of level six (soooo useful...).

2) Fire Bridge Trick - If the game difficulty level is not set to hard (you can check this by the zombies' speed), the fire bridge can be traversed by simply going right without stopping.

3) Weird Spots - In levels five and six there are spots where you can jump through the yellow rock background: usually getting blocked or killed. In level six, the floor below the bosses' has an invisible hole in it at the extreme left: this can be used to the player's advantage.

4) Cemetery Glitch - Reach the last tomb before the devil, jump it and go right two or three steps. The knight should now be in front of a tree on the background. Don't go any further - go back, instead. Climb the first ladder you'll meet, then climb down the one on the left, which shouldn't be completely on the screen if you peformed the trick correctly: surprise!

5) Warp Trick - This is very odd: by a strategy similar to the one to reveal the cemetery glitch (that is, fiddling with scroll), you can activate a 'level warp' in the platform section at the beginning of level four. It involves going right, then trying to have some platform carry you beyond the 'scroll stops' line on the left. This should kill the knight and possibly make the next life start on the fire bridge or in level 5.


* Armor:

1) The first armor is in the cemetery, between the red devil's starting position and last money bag: jump there to catch it. In the forest,there's the infamous unreachable armor: to collect it you should reach a spot just above the money bag right after the first plant. This cannot be done by jumping.

2) There are two armors in the ice palace. One can be gotten by walking left off the topmost platform; the other will fall right in front of the inferior plant by roaming around the other plant's location.

3) There are two armors in the blue cave. The first one is obtained by climbing the leftmost ladder and falling off the ledge. To get the second, perform a well-placed jump (you have to cross some precise point in mid-air while falling) before the fight with the last red devil.

4) The last armor is collected in level six by simply walking right on the first floor with hulk-like monsters on it (The programmers thought you couldn't avoid getting hit by the ogres and so they didn't hide that armor).

Ginga Ninkyouden (c) 10/1987 Jaleco.


- TRIVIA -


The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Galactic Chivalry Story'.


AThis game is a parody of anime, manga, and other bits of Japanese popular culture. The defauld hi-score table's names are the names of various anime studios (4, 6-8) and manga publications (1, 5).


The list of enemies in attract mode is only partial. 'G. Robo' is Giant Robo, from the 7-part OVA series of the same name. 'Zaku' is from the original TV and movie series Mobile Suit Gundam, and was the Jion's main unit during the One-Year War era. 'Joe' is Joe Yabuki from Tomorrow's Joe, and is in fact the very same Joe from the Neo-Geo game "Legend of Success Joe".


On level 7, the guy with the hat and the bazooka is Jigen Daisuke from Lupin III (see the history entry for "Lupin III" for more info). The kung-fu guy who explodes when you kill him is Ken from Fist of the North Star, consisting of two TV series and one (bad) movie. Ken used a kung-fu technique that involved striking pressure points, causing his enemies to messily explode with a single tap of a finger.


The house that you pass through in level 1 is the apartment from Maison Ikkoku. The guy by the hole in the wall is Yotsuya, who broke the wall so he could more effectively pester his neighbor (the main character, Godai). The woman with the broom in the room next door is Kyoko, the landlady. The clock on the roof doesn't work.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Two Player Health Restoral: If a player's health is at zero (no life bar visible) when the bonus level/intermission ends, s/he will begin the next level at full health (three life bars). So if you CAREFULLY hack one another, you can restore your health. You should allow the other character to recover after each swipe, otherwise you may throw or kick and actually kill the other player.

Golly! Ghost! (c) 1990 Namco.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the Namco System 2 hardware.


The game featured a genuine doll's house hooked up to a pinball-style motor board. The motors allowed certain parts of the doll's house to move under CPU control (to allow the ghosts to come out of the toilet etc.). To project the ghosts, a monitor was placed in the base of the cabinet, projecting an inverted image onto a pane of glass. This system proved to be such a good way of removing interference when operating genuine lightguns (the ones in Golly! Ghost! were actually joysticks) that this reflection system has been used in upright lightgun games from Namco ever since (including "Point Blank"). One interesting point, since the ghosts are not in this dimension and can pass through walls why do they need to open doors to get in.

Gomoku Narabe Renju (c) 1981 Nichibutsu.


- TRIVIA -


The ancient Asian game of 'Go' is called 'Gomoku Narabe' in Japan, meaning 'five in a row'. The object of the game is to simply get five of your chips in a row. Sounds simple, but there are endless strategies and philosophies to this game. The game presented in Gomoku Narabe Renju is a combination of 'Go-Moku Narabe' and 'Ninuki Renju' - a synthesis of two similar board games that use a Go board where the objective is to make five in a row.

- TRIVIA -


This game is known outside Japan as "I'm Sorry".


This game runs on the Sega System 1 hardware.


This game is mostly Japanese nonsense satire. The title is a play on the word 'sori', which means 'Prime Minister'. The main character is former Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, infamous for his plutocracy. Enemy characters include Carl Lewis, Michael Jackson, Japanese comedian Tamori and professional wrestler Giant Baba.


This game looks as if there might be a little S & M going on. When the human in sunglasses catches you, his clothes change to a black bikini and he now has a whip or riding crop. Your clothes change into a white diaper.

- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the Bally Midway Astrocade hardware.


Gorf has almost classic status and it became legendary for its almost unintelligible speech.


Note: Ever notice that GORF is FROG spelled backwards? :). Seriously, GORF is an acronym for 'Galactic Orbital Robot Force'.


GORF was the first game ever to show multiple scenes.


A Star Trek tie in was originally planned by Midway, but when the first movie fell flat, the Enterprise sprite was reused as the Gorf flagship.


During the attract modes and gameplay, Gorf says a number of humorous things. Here are a few: 'Try again! I devour coins!', 'Ha ha ha ha!', 'Prepare for annihilation!', 'All hail the supreme Gorfian Empire!', 'Long Live Gorf!'.


Jay designed a sequel to Gorf called 'Mrs. Gorf', but it was never released.


A Gorf unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' and in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.

A Bish-bashi knockoff suitable for children. In the English language version, the voice over artist talks incredibly quickly. The reason is that, in order to minimise the reprogramming, the new ADPCM samples had to take up the same space as the original Japanese ones. Since Japanese sentences are, in general, shorter (due to the phonetic nature of the alphabet) time was very tight (Even at that speed, she still didn't manage all the samples required).

Gravitar (c) 08/1982 Atari.

Game ID: 136010


- TRIVIA -


The prototype of this game is known as "Lunar Battle".


Developed in 14 months, Gravitar was the first game that Mike Hally produced and designed for Atari.


The concept of Gravitar was based on a combination of "Lunar Lander" and "Asteroids".


Gravitar was the first game to have a real-time dynamic perspective - When you enter a planet, the screen zooms in to give you a closer look. Unfortunately, it was a colossal failure, primarily because of its difficulty. While beautiful to look at for its time, the learning curve was too steep too early - When you're plugging quarters into a machine, you stop playing a tough game. But interest in the title has resurged among hard-core arcade gamers. This is because once the controls are mastered, the game is phenomenally addictive.


Approximately 5,420 units were produced.


A Gravitar unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', in the 1983 movie 'James Bond 007 - Never Say Never Again' and in the 1987 movie 'Death Wish 4 - The Crackdown'.


In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including: "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Depending on the highest score, one of eight list names appears above the table of initials...

Between 0 and 20,000 pts: FLUNKY

Between 20,001 and 40,000 pts: GUNNER

Between 40,001 and 80,000 pts: CO-PILOT

Between 80,001 and 100,000 pts: PILOT

Between 100,001 and 200,000 pts: ACE PILOT

Between 201,001 and 400,000 pts: KILLER PILOT

Between 400,001 and 800,000 pts: PONTIUS PILATE

Above 800,000 pts: GOTTA-BE-LUCKY


* A Well Known Cheat/Bug: At a joint between two vectors (>90 degrees), position yourself below and shoot straight up. If you can align yourself just right, the shots will travel through the walls at the joint. Without moving from side to side, just thrust up and voila, you are now inside the wall. You can now move around and shoot the gun pods from behind. This is especially useful if you can get under the world!

- TRIVIA -


Originally called 'Race For Pink', as in pink slips, the certificates of ownership in California. Atari then realized that pink slips are not universal, so the name was changed. This represent the very last coin-op game designed by Owen Rubin and the end of his career. But unfortunately, this prototype was never finished / never released. In this prototype version, buying parts for your car was made VERY simple to speed up the game. In the final version, you would see your car in a garage up on a lift, and a garage full of parts you could 'buy' to make your car better. Better tires, better suspension, better brakes, better engine, better transmission. Owen was going to make the races longer, maybe 10 laps. And was going to add cops and traffic lights in the city. Run a red light, the cop chases you. If he bumped you, you stopped for a while to get a ticket! This would have been one GREAT driving game.

Gun Fight, which was designed on TTL-based hardware by Taito, which was adapted to 8080 hardware by Nutting, was the first Japanese title to be licensed for release in America. It was also the first video game to incorporate a microprocessor and the expanded processing capabilities allowed for graphics and gameplay much more advanced than "Pong".


Gun Fight was a pretty important videogames innovator. It was the first game ever to have two on-screen humans battling against each other at the same time, and as such it's the grandfather of the fighting games that take up most of the floorspace in modern arcades. It also introduced the idea of having separate controls for aiming and moving.


A Gun Fight unit appears in the 1978 movie 'Dawn of the Dead'.

Destroy the evil army with three Japanese characters and the spirits that possess them in this beautiful vertical shoot-'em-up.


- TRIVIA -


The story of Guwange is set during the Muromachi period of Japan. Sorcerers in eastern Japan would predict the day's fishing catch by the appearance of a fox-like voice from the mountains. If the voice sounded 'koon koon' then there was to be a great catch. If the voice sounded 'gwange gwange' then it was to be a horrible catch. The people soon named the place of the voice 'Prison-Gate Mountain', as all who saw the origin of this voice were never seen again. The people soon began to worship this being as the god of Prison-Gate Mountain. It is said that the men later came to call it 'Lord Guwange'. The game title of 'Guwange' appears to reflect the name of this mysterious mountain voice and also the 'bad' sound that it made to predict a horrible catch.

After designing "Time Pilot", Okamoto did Gyruss, that, although a hit, came out at a time when the arcade craze was dying down. Therefore, it didn't sell the numbers it so rightly deserved. Okamoto asked for a raise, or he would quit. The next day, when he showed up for work, he was informed he was fired. Gyruss is most often remembered for its fine musical score that plays throughout the game (Bach's 'Toccata and Fugue in D Minor').

This game was inspired by the actual 'Comet Halley' (pronounced HAL-lee). It was named after 'Edmund Halley', who calculated its '76-year orbital period'. Comet Halley was visible in 1910 and 76 years after, in 1986 (The feb. 9 exactly), just the year when this game was released by Taito :). Its next perihelion passage will be in 2061.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Level Boss Trick: Shoot all but one of these squares and then press the hyperspace button (the smartbomb) when the final square is lit. You should now recieve 1 000 000 points! (this works for all level bosses).


* Another Tip: When the game is in Game Over mode, you can actually control the ship at one point. This is rather useless, but fun!

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


All these tricks work in Japanese version only, Hard Puncher!


* Unlock A Secret World: Begin a normal game. Then, at the opening blue screen, press Left, Right, Up, Right, Down, Right, Left(x2). If done correctly, a bell will sound. Now your rivals will be much harder and even connect specialty punches they didn't originally have. Also, you'll be able to string 20-hit combos on some opponents. Beat this game mode and you'll be awarded $20,000,000 instead of 10 (Note: This code appears briefly on screen after beating the game in Regular mode).


* Unlock A Powerful World: Begin a normal game. Then, at the opening blue screen, press Right, Up, Left(x2), Down, Up, Right, Down. If done correctly, a bell will sound. Now knockdowns will occur whenever a punch is landed (like sans power in Mortal Kombat). Beat this game mode and you'll be awarded $20,000,000 instead of 10 (Note: This code appears briefly on screen after beating the game in Secret World mode).


* Alien Ball In Power Training Session: Go to the Power Training Session and hit all 50 volleyballs. Then, an alien-like ball with veins and teeth will be thrown at your head. If you miss, it will bite your face, but if you hit it, you'll receive an additional 10% increment, for a grand total of a 30% power increment.


* Moai Mask: Sometimes the referee will be wearing a mask of Moai, the stone head from Parodius and Cue Brick. I haven't confirmed what triggers this particular trick, but I think it could have something to do with the timer. -Maybe winning at 2:22, 1:11, or something like that-


* Alternate Credits Roll: Beat the game in New or Powerful World mode. When the credits roll, the names will remain the same but the titles will be different. 'Making of this game' is replaced by 'Staff of Conjax Pro'. Also, keep an eye out for a cameo by Pentarou the penguin from Parodius during either credits roll.


* The Mob Never Forgives: When you win the game and get the park scene, look carefully in the background to spot two hit men armed with UZIs and gunning down a poor guy. The girl next to him tries to run. Is this subliminal violence??

Holosseum (c) 1992 Sega.


The first (and hopefully only) holographic fighter featuring four selectable characters representing different martial arts. I'll let you in on a little secret - my legs are stronger than my arms!


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the Sega System 32 hardware.


This game was released as a conversion kit for Time Traveler since the laser disc players in the original games turned out to be unreliable.


This is the only game other than Time Traveller to use the hi-tech hologram theater cabinet created by Sega. Indeed, Holosseum was written to convince arcade owners that it was worth investing in the expensive cabinet. The Winners Don't use Drugs message distorts in the real cabinet, as it was programmed incorrectly, beyond the range of the projection mirror. The theater works because of a concave mirror inside the cabinet, which reflects a specially framed image produced on a standard monitor. Because of the nature of a concave mirror, the focussed image appears as if it is floating in mid-air, provided that the interior of the cabinet is painted black to absorb any excess reflection (Note the pure black background on both of these games). Also, the image focus may appear to change across the screen, this is due to having to take into account the thickness of the mirror at different points, known as spherical abberation).

- TRIVIA -


This game is known in US as "Track and Field".


This game is a resounding success, especially amongst real-life athletes who live to take out their aggression on animate or inanimate objects. The game inspires an all-new level of two-player competition in arcades.


- UPDATES -


The bootleg version features different speech, as the original sound hardware could not be totally hacked - the slightly different voices are allegedly those of the bootleggers themselves! Also, it contains a typo: the word HEIGHT replaces the original HIGHT.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hidden Bonus: When you get to the javelin throw, run fast and then hold the angle button down, making the javelin soar high into the air. If it gets high enough, it'll hit a bird, which will fall and give you 1000 points.


* Hidden Bonus 2: On the high jump, if you fail your first two jumps then qualify on the third, a little mole pops up and you get a bonus.


* Hidden Bonus 3: In the 100 metres, if you manage to get a dead heat with the computer (i.e. the same time) you get a 1000 point bonus.

Atari had this stupid policy that bonuses for engineers were based on profits from sales of machines, *without* taking into account the amount of engineering resources (man years) spent developing it. I.e., just the sales revenue minus the manufacturing cost. Therefor engineers were motivated to spend ridiculous amounts of time reducing the manufacturing cost. They decided that the only way to reduce the cost of the game was to replace a lot of TTL logic with an ASIC. Unfortunately, they assigned very inexperienced people to do the ASIC design. The resulting chip had very low yield. However, by this time the game was so late that they weren't allowed to fix the ASIC. Aside from the time it would take to redo the chip, fixing it would also require putting it in a larger package with more power and ground pins and so the board would have to be redone as well. So for each production unit they just tried chips until they found one that seemed to work, then shipped the unit. They threw away a lot of chips. Approximately 1,000 units were produced.

This game runs on the Sega Model 2B hardware.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Fifth View: To access a secret fifth view, switch to the fourth view during the race, then press any two view change buttons simultaneously.


* Mirror Mode: Hold the red zoom in button while pressing Start to begin the game. All of the track graphics and text will be flipped horizontally.


* Mirror Mode And Power Steering: Hold both Zoom buttons while pressing Start to begin your game. You'll be playing in mirror mode and the steering wheel will turn more freely. Note: These tricks will only work on the 'twin type' machines and not on the deluxe 'dx' type.


* Backwards Tracks: Hold the shift lever Down while starting a game. You'll be driving the track in the opposite direction. Note: That in a multiplayer game the course direction is determined with majority rule; that is it won't work unless the majority of the players hold their shifter Down at this time.


* Drive The Pace Car: After choosing a course-but before the race starts, step on the Brake and simultaneously press the Start button. You'll be driving the mustang pace car.


* Vs. Pace Cars: After choosing a course-but before the race starts, step on the Brake and simultaneously push the shift lever Up. This will change your opponents car to pace cars. Note: That in a multiplayer game, this will only change the appearence of the cars which are controlled by your game board (your screen only will be affected).


* Front View: To see your car from front to back, switch to the third or fourth view during the race, then press the Start button and both view change buttons simultaneously.


* Position Markers: Hold the Start button when changing views to make the car's position markers appear above the cars.


* Trailer Tricks: At the transmission select screen, step on the Brake to close the door on the trailer that holds your car or step on the Gas to view your car coming out of the trailer.


* Bird Trick: When driving on the 'Highland Raceway' track in 'Backwards Track Mode' a flock of birds will cling to your car. If you immediately make a u-turn and drive in the opposite direction, the birds will stick with you for the rest of the game.

- TRIVIA -


This was Skelly's second game for Gottlieb, but it was never released. Number produced estimated at 1 or 2 units.


The cool thing about Insector is the three-letter code in at the start. Tim Skelly use this value as a seed for each player's pseudo random number generator. That way, if you want exactly the same game every time, you enter the same three letters. If you wanted to handicap yourself, you would enter different letters and let the other player enter their usual letters, etc.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Make The Game Easier: Tim put in this game a secret code that made the game easier. Enter 'DDT' on the three-letter start (David Thiel's initials).

IPM Invader (c) 1979 Irem.


- TRIVIA -


Known as the poor mans version of "Space Invaders". IPM Invader was manufactured by a company called IPM, which later changed it's name to IREM.


- UPDATES -


It is like "Space Invaders", with identical graphics. It uses a color monitor instead of a black and white monitor with a color overlay.


It has the addition of the famous 'coffee break'. What's the 'coffee break'? The 'coffee break' is a unique feature in IPM Invaders whereas after every 3rd wave or pattern of invaders, the 'coffee break' appears.


Another unique feature in IPM Invader is the 'capsules'. When dip switch settings are changed to advanced settings, the game becomes more difficult with the introduction of the UFO (mystery score ship) dropping 'capsules' that hatch into new invaders. The 'capsules' cannot be destroyed until they hatch, and are dropped across the screen to defeat the players 'narrow column' strategy. The 'coffee break' picture above shows the UFO dropping 'capsules'.

This game runs on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware.


Janshin Densetsu appears to be a complete ripoff of 1991's "Mahjong Quest" by Taito. The basic premise is the same: a girl in an RPG-style format walking along a world map and encountering enemies which are battled through mahjong matches. The enemy encounter screens have identical borders and the enemies are drawn in the same comic-anime style. Before each mahjong match, there are selectable spells that can be bought with stored MP, the screen and spells being identical in both cases. The player also has a Sword and Shield which can be activated during a match which give the player special abilities. The in-game text is virtually identical. The mahjong tiles themselves look almost exactly the same save for the backs; the mahjong game screen itself is almost exactly the same. Even upon defeating an enemy, they are turned into a scantily-clad woman as does your character when she is defeated. The only major difference between the two seems to be that "Mahjong Quest" is controlled with a mahjong control panel and Jyanshin Densetsu is controlled with the MVS Neo-Geo joystick. The next Aicom game on SNK Neo-Geo MVS is 1995's "Pulstar", shares lots of similarities with "R-Type" as well.

Used digitized faces of the band members, photographed with a camera designed by Ralph Baer, father of the home video game console. The machine contained a tape loop of the song 'Separate Ways (World's Apart)' in the concert scene at the end of each level. Rushed through the 1982 Christmas holidays by the Marvin Glass team because Bally/Midway wanted the game to coincide with the release of the band's Frontiers album. They took all the images of the band backstage at a Salt Lake City concert. There was talk of using the game as part of the road show, but that fell through.

* Secret Screen: On Journey's attract screen (the one with the face), press all the buttons (Blast, 1P Start, 2P Start) and the joystick to the Left and you'll get a screen with the programmer's names and tiny digitized pictures.

Joust (c) 09/1982 Williams.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the "Defender" hardware.


The name of this game is a reference for 'Jousting'. Jousting is a competition between two knights on horse-back, wherein each knight tries to knock the other off his mount. Jousting was popular in medieval times.


Joust shares some sounds from "Defender".


A Joust unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.


- UPDATES -


Red version has default high score of 107,212 Pts, Green and Yellow versions are 109,102 Pts. Also, the Green version fixes a well known bug that allowed you to endlessly kill Pterodactyls on certain levels, thus achieving incredible scores.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* The Pterodactyl Trick: Classic trick! Doesn't work on upgraded Joust machines, or on "Joust 2". Trick the last jouster on the stage to fly to the lava and get trapped by the lava troll. Then wait in the center of the middle platform. When a pterodactyl comes out, it'll fly right into your lance. The next part takes a fair amount of practice: when the pterodactyl has hit you, your character will be knocked back. Jiggle the joystick so that your mount is back in the middle of the ledge again. Keep doing this. Eventually there'll be a steady stream of pterodactyls and you'll be killing 'em about 2 per second, for 1000 points each. When you make a mistake and get killed, the trapped jouster will escape. On the last board in which this works (47), the jouster will not escape.


* Phantom Energizer: In a 2-player game (on a screen just before the middle ledge disappears) clear all opponents except 1. Kill him, leaving the egg in the middle of the bottom platform. Player 1 stands on the bottom energizer while player 2 jumps in the lava. If player 2 appears on the top energizer, then the trick will work. Player 1 then gets the egg. The 'phantom' ledge should remain.

A modified version of this game is known as "Pirate Pete".


This game runs on the Taito SJ System hardware.


It was the first 'side-scrolling, jumping & attacking game', appearing in arcades three years before Miyamoto's classic "Super Mario Bros.".


The original Japanese game ("Jungle King") feature a character who looked like the well known and very much copyrighted Tarzan. The character even sounded like Tarzan when he bellowed out the famous Tarzan scream after finishing the boulder stage (and at the beginning of the game). So, for legal reasons, the name was changed to 'Jungle Hunt' and the character was changed to resemble a classic jungle explorer complete with the standard issue safari hat and shorts. The bellowed scream at the end of the boulder stage was also entirely removed.


A Jungle Hunt unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames'.


MB (Milton bradley) released a boardgame based on this videogame (same name) in 1983.

The King of Fighters '94 (c) 08/1994 SNK.

Game ID: 0055


Twenty-four selectable characters in fixed teams of three clash to defeat Rugal Bernstein.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and four buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware.


The King of Fighters (or KOF for short) revolutionized the fighter genre with the introduction of 3 member team fighting called the 'team battle system', and by combining elements of two of SNK's existing fighting game in "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" and "Art of Fighting", as well as bringing back characters from games predating the MVS in "Ikari Warriors" and "Psycho Soldier". A new game in the series is produced every year.


At the demo previous to the first Rugal encounter, Rugal shows your team the statues he has gathered by turning his opponents into them. One of the statues is of a guy that looks a lot like Capcom's Guile making a Sonic Boom. Capcom later confirmed that it was indeed Guile's statue in "Capcom Vs. SNK". When Guile fights Rugal that statue is shown and later destroyed by Guile.


An interesting thing about Chang and Choi: Chang was the tallest and heaviest KOF character, while Choi was the lightest and shortest. The duo is very popular in Japan, but hated by American fans. Because of their size differences, they have made a (quite) comedic couple, making the Korean team (or the Kim team) the comedy-relief team of KOF.


The design of Benimaru Nikkaido is based on Jean-Pierre Polnaref from "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure".


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The King of Fighters '94 - PCCB-00162) on 21/10/1994.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Select Victory Pose: Press a Punch or Kick button immediately after winning a match.


* Critical Hit Oddity: A critical hit is an attack done at the opponent while he/she is attacking. In this game there is a bug that enables either the CPU or the player to take out insane amounts of damage if this is done right. An easy-to-do example is to counter Kim's Hisho-Kyaku with Heidern's Moon Cutter (you must hit Kim's legs with Heidern's hand), if done right you'll take 80-90% off Kim's lifebar in one hit! Try it with other characters and be amazed (This does not work in any other game in the KOF series, though!). :)

The King of Fighters '96 (c) 07/1996 SNK.

Game ID: 0214


The third chapter in this groundbreaking series brings 27 classic SNK characters together against Goenitz, the final boss.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and four buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware.


This is the first game to include special phrases and poses when two characters in particular fight. In this game, it happens only with Kyo Vs. Iori and Terry Vs. Geese.


Ryo Sakazaki's fighting stance changed from the regular 'dukes up' to try and distance him from being thought of as a Ryu ripoff. His basic moves, however, remained unchanged.


Yuri's Yuri Chou Mawashi Geri is a knock-off of Ryu's Tatsumaki Senpuu Kyaku.


If you look at the game code for this game, you would have seen more moves that were originally planned for this game, but never made the cut (for some characters, these moves debuted in later games).

Among those moves that were cut were Kyo's Saishuu Kessen Ougi 'Mu Shiki', Daimon's Arashi no Yama, Robert's Muei Senpuu Juudan Kyaku, Ralf's Umanori Vulcan Punch, Clark's Running Three, Geese's Deadly Rave and Choi's Hou'ou Kyaku.


Geese's music (Geese ni Katakori) is a remixed version of his Fatal Fury 1 theme music (Geese ni Kiss).

A remixed version of Big Shot! (originally Terry's theme music in Fatal Fury 3) was used as the Fatal Fury Team's music.


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The King of Fighters '96 - PCCB-00223) on 21/08/1996.

The name of the three characters instrumental in the defeat of Orochi have some relation to the original legend:

1) Kyo Kusanagi: The Kusanagi is the name of the sword that was used to kill the Great Serpent.

2) Iori Yagami: One of his moves, the Ya Sakazuki, means 'eight wine cups', which were needed to get the Great Serpent drunk.

3) Chizuru Kagura: She was the last surviving member of the Yata clan and the mirror used to seal Orochi away was a homage to the mirror in the legend (in the legend, it was a mirror created by the Great Serpent's tears).

The King of Fighters '98 - The Slugfest (c) 07/1998 SNK.

Game ID: 0242


A special edition of the KoF series taking place outside of the established storyline with a whopping 38 selectable KoF alumni.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and four buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game is known in Japan as "The King of Fighters '98 - Dream Match Never Ends".


This game runs on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware.


It is said that this game is a 'dream match' for more reasons than one - this KOF is said to exist only in Shingo's dream - each character in this dream match was Shingo's impression of these characters, based on either personal experience or his notes in his notebook.


Yuri has a long record of taking movements from other characters, especially Capcom (see previous KOF entries). In this new opus: Yuri's new special attack 'Shin! Chou Upper' is a knock off of Ryu's Shin Shoryuu Ken. She also has a movement similar to Terry's burn knuckle. Finally, her Forward+A is a parody of Sakura's Flower Kick.


KOF98 contains pieces of music from older KOFs.

For example, the character select music when a second player joins in is straight from KOF 96 (it's called Roulette).

Here's a complete list of themes, the teams (or individuals) they belong to and the games they were taken from:

Esaka? (Japan Team): KOF 96 (Japan Team's theme music).

Esaka (95-style Kyo Kusanagi): KOF 94 (Japan Team's theme music).

Kurikinton (Fatal Fury Team): Fatal Fury 2 (Terry Bogard's theme music).

Art of Fight (Art of Fighting Team): Art of Fighting (Ryo Sakazaki's and Ryuhaku Todo's theme music).

Rumbling in the City (Ikari Team): KOF 96 (Ikari Team's theme music).

Shin! Senritsu no Dora (Psycho Soldier Team): KOF95 (Psycho Soldier Team's theme music).

Fairy (Gals Fighters Team): KOF 96 (Chizuru Kagura's theme music).

Seoul Town (Korea Team): Real Bout Fatal Fury (Kim Kaphwan's theme music).

Bloody (New Face Team): KOF 97 (New Face Team's theme music).

Rhythmic Hallucination (Orochi Yashiro): KOF 97 (Orochi New Face Team's theme music).

C62 (Ryuji Yamazaki): Real Bout Fatal Fury Special (Ryuji Yamazaki's theme music).

Blue Mary's Blues (Blue Mary): Real Bout Fatal Fury Special (Blue Mary's theme music).

London March (Billy Kane): Real Bout Fatal Fury Special (Billy Kane's theme music).

Arashi no Saxophone (Iori Yagami): KOF 95 (Revenge Team's theme music).

Arashi no Saxophone 2 (Mature, Vice): KOF 96 (Iori Team's theme music).

Slum No. 5 (USA Sports Team): KOF 94 (USA Sports Team's theme music).

Still Green (Shingo Yabuki): KOF 97 (Shingo Yabuki's theme music).

Ketchaku R&D (Omega Rugal): first half from KOF 94 (Rugal Bernstein's theme music), second half from KOF 95 (Omega Rugal's theme music).

Ne! ('94 Gals Fighters Team): KOF 94 (Gals Fighters Team's theme music).


Also to note that the music that is played prior to facing Rugal (Kettou R&D) is also from KOF 94 (as the theme for Rugal's first form).


When Choi Bounge appears, a 7 seconds sample from a song is played. This song is 'Choi Bounge Ondo', which appeared in the KOF 97 Arrange SoundTracks. The song became quite popular in Japan.


Mr. Big from "Art of Fighting" makes a small cameo appearance in the USA Wharf background, during the first rounds.


A serious bug: Using a USA bios rom if you insert a coin on the 'winners dont use drugs' screen on a single slot the games will use the neogeo bios s1 tileset rather than the game tiles, this causes most of the graphics to be hidden and the games to be unplayable, it will also end up using the mainboard z80 bios so sound will be broken, the games should fix themselves if you let them run another attact loop after gameover, on a multi-slot the games will reset. This is one of the first 4 'gigapower' games, the bug was fixed after that.


- UPDATES -


At the Intro music (CIPHER) and the Staff Roll BGM (ZERO) a sample used says 'mot*er fu**er'. Apparently, this sample was removed in some non-Japanese carts.

The King of Fighters 2000 (c) 07/2000 SNK.

Game ID: 0257


Thirty-four characters. Plus the popular striker system, await to be selected to team up and defeat the mighty Zero and his incredible bladed coat!

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and four buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware.


The names of some of Zero's moves are inspired from the Japanese anime 'Hokuto no Ken'.


Robert's 'Ryuugeki Ken' is a knock-off of the Sonic Boom (It isn't in "The King of Fighters '99 - Millennium Battle" because of its looks, despite the charging motion).


There are two symbolic things that tell you how the people at SNK were forseeing the end of their company. Kyo's theme is called 'Good Bye Esaka', Esaka is the avenue where the SNK building and Neo Geo Land are (Esaka means 'entrance to the hill'). The second thing is the destruction of the city that started all: South Town (Home of "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" and "Art of Fighting" - however, note that in "Garou - Mark of The Wolf", Second South was rebuilt near South Town. Also noted is the fact that every Kyo theme before 'Tears' had 'Esaka' in it ('Esaka' in 94, 'Funky Esaka' in 95, 'Esaka?' in 96 and 'Esaka Forever' in 97).

The reason for those names is that in "The King of Fighters '94", Kyo's team stage is below a bridge in the Esaka area near SNK. In "The King of Fighters '95", they fight in front of Neo Geo Land, again, in Esaka in front of the SNK building. In "The King of Fighters '96", they fight in top of a bridge also in the Esaka area. In "The King of Fighters '97" there is no Esaka stage, however, this was supposed to be the last KOF as SNK planned to move to the HNG64, it was like a glorious farewell to KOF, however, things went different. Finally, in "The King of Fighters '98 - The Slugfest", the Esaka stage appears again; they fight below a bridge in front of the Neo Geo Land.

It's simple concept, and easy to play. Catch the colored tiles with the paddle and flip them into bins to make same colored stacks and rows of three. Sound easy ? It is. The hard part is pulling yourself away from the game :). A second player can join in at any time, head-to-head action a competitive challenge for two players.

- TRIVIA -


This game is also known as "Triple Punch" (KKI).


This game runs on the "Scramble" hardware.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Begin by filling in the box in the lower left-hand corner. Once you've done that, fill in the two boxes (vertically) to its right, then the three to their right, and so on until you've effectively wrapped around the playfield and are back at the first box you filled in. Just repeat this motion until all of the boxes are full.


* Also remember that real points are to be gained not by filling in two boxes at once, but by punching out an enemy while the ambulance is still on-screen taking away another enemy. Doing this gives you 600 points as compared to the usual 300, or 150-200 for filling two boxes simultaneously.

A bootleg of this game was released by O.K. corp. in 1985.


First scrolling beat-em-up, this game is based on the movie 'Wheels on Meals', starring Jackie Chan (as Thomas) and Sammo Hung (who also directed). This movie is called 'Spartan X' in Japan.


- UPDATES -


Differences between Spartan X and Kung-Fu Master:

* During the demo screen the word Kung-Fu (in 'A KUNG-FU MASTER, THOMAS....') is spelled 'KANFU' in Spartan X.

* Spartan X has an additional copyright notice that is not in Kung-Fu Master: '(C)1984 Paragon Films Ltd., Towa Promotion'.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Slow Motion Mode: Turn 'slow motion mode' ON in dipswitch. In game, press Start 2 to slow game speed.


* Stop Mode: Turn 'Freeze' ON in dipswitch. In game, press Start 2 to stop and Start 1 to restart.


* Level Selection Mode: Turn 'Level selection mode' ON in dipswitch. In game, press Start 1 to select and Start 2 to restart.


* Hint: Time your punches properly. They give you double score compared with the kicks, but they're much more risky, as you can fall short with your punch and get grabbed.


* Defeating the Bosses:

1) FIRST BOSS: Easy. Wait to his first pole swing from a safe distance and then quickly get close (stuck) to him. From now on, his attacks won't hit you. Walk forward (making him walk back) until you reach the staircases and then start punching him in the belly.

2) SECOND BOSS: First, clean your back of henchmen. Then, wait for the boomerang dude to throw his first boomerang , avoid it and this is the time! You have to hit him like hell while he's waiting to recover his boomerang. Punches hurt double. If you're quick enough punching, he won't recover his first boomerang.

3) THIRD BOSS: Just make a jumping moving kick, hit him in the chest, and as soon you touch the floor (falling down from the jumping kick) start punching fast as hell! With any luck he won't touch you anyway. Be sure to have spare energy to perform this movement just in case he has time to give you a kick (1/4 of the bar would be enough).

4) FOURTH BOSS: Watch out, this one is tricky. First, take him to the limits where he can walk (He suddenly stops as he can't get closer to you). Then come closer to him and duck, avoiding his projectiles. Then, a copy of him will appear at your back. Stand up and start walking (avoiding projectiles again) just as you did with the first boss. As soon as you arrive at the stairs, duck and start punching. He will appear and disappear, but JUST in front of you. Six punches and he's history.

5) FIFTH BOSS: Mainly keep him defending himself with high kicks (tapping very fast!) and then suddenly change to low kicks. Start with a jumping moving kick in the chest (just like the third boss) and then start the high/low kicks patterns.

Difference between "Twin Cobra" and Kyukyoku Tiger:

* T.C. supports two simultaneous players.

* K.T. supports two players, but only one at a time.

* For this reason, it also supports Table Top cabinets.

* T.C. stores 3 characters for high scores.

* K.T. stores 6 characters for high scores.

* T.C. heroes are Red and Blue for player 1 and 2 respectively.

* K.T. heroes are grey for both players.

*T.C. dead remains of ground tanks are circular.

* K.T. dead remains of ground tanks always vary in shape.

* T.C. continues new hero and continued game at current position.

* K.T. continues new hero and continued game at predefined positions. After dying and your new hero appears, if you do not travel more than your helicopter length forward, you are penalised and moved back further when your next hero appears.

* K.T. Due to this difference in continue sequence, Kyukyoku Tiger is MUCH harder, challenging and nearly impossible to complete !

Akari and Juzoh are the comedic relief characters in the Gekka series: If Akari is fighting someone other than Juzoh, Juzoh can be seen next to the elephant. If Akari is fighting Juzoh, Akari's three friends (Hijiri Nanase, Aoi Yahata and Shizuka Kujou) can be seen next to the elephant. If Juzoh is fighting someone other than Akari, Akari can be seen with her friends.


- UPDATES -


In the original (Japanese) version of Last Blade 2, each of the three modes is described by one kanji: Chikara (red), Waza (blue) and Kiwame (green). Chikara means 'strength', Waza 'skill' and Kiwame 'extreme'.

These three modes were made into 'Power', 'Speed' and 'EX', respectively, for their English release.

However, one case where the modes were literally translated remain.

If you look at the English 'How To Play' intro in Last Blade 2, you will see 'Strength and Skill' where they should have said 'Power and Speed'.

A slight mistake in the English renaming, or a tribute to the Japanese and therefore correct, names.

The Last Blade (c) 11/1997 SNK.

Game ID: 0234


Japanese weapons-based fighter featuring beautiful artwork and sound. Twelve selectable characters and two end bosses.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and four buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game is known in Japan as "Bakumatsu Roman - Gekka no Kenshi" (translates from Japanese as 'Bakumatsu Romance - Swordsman In The Moonlight').


This game runs on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware.


Parts of Gekka no Kenshi was based off of the manga 'Rurouni Kenshin'.


The Bakumatsu period of Japan (1860-1899) represents the opening of Japanese ports to foreigners. The Last Blade is set during this time period and you can see Europeans in some backgrounds, as well as some European dress influences on some characters.


This game has a lot to do with Japanese religion. In what little understanding of Japanese culture, there are four gods in Japanese mythology: Seiryuu (blue dragon), Suzaku (red phoenix), Byakko (white tiger) and Genbu. Each god is associated with a direction: Byakko with west, Seiryuu with east, Genbu with north and Suzaku in the south. The four gods also seem to be portrayed in an identical manner: Suzaku is often seen as a renegade of sorts, Genbu is often wise, Byakko seems to be strong and Seiryuu seems to be the role of the protagonist. To this end, the four characters that are avatars to these gods in Gekka no Kenshi (Kaede, Okina, Shigen and Kagami) seem to fit the gods themselves to a tee (Kaede to Seiryuu, Okina to Genbu, Shigen to Byakko and Kagami to Suzaku). However, there may be one (unintentional) reference to the entire fighting game itself. These four characters may very well represent the four popular styles of characters found in nearly fighting game:

Kaede is a Shotokan-style character. This type of character, of course, is the earliest type of fighting game character (as early fighting games always had the protagonist be proficient in some form of karate). However, ever since the release of "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior", a Shoto-character refers to a character with similar moves to that of Ryu and Ken from that game, or more specifically, a character with a projectile and a built upper. Kaede fits this property well: his Ittou Hayate is a projectile (much like Ryu's Hadou Ken) and his Ittou Kuuga is a built upper (like Ken's Shoryuu Ken). Of course, Kaede may also be a nod to that of SNK's first fighting game protagonist (Terry Bogard) as well: his Kasshin Fukuryuu super is in the style of Terry's Power Geyser. To this day, many fighting game characters are known as Shoto characters - their simplicity can't be beat.

Shigen is a large character. Large characters come generally in two flavors: the power character and the grappler (Shigen himself is a mix of both). Power characters generally don't move much but deal lots of damage per hit. Grapplers are those whose special moves are mainly throws. These characters tend to last longer because of their size, but have a weakness that they have either short range or are slow (or, in the case of some characters, overly complicated moves).

Okina may be described as a turtler. This may seem like an inside joke (Okina, in his profile, refers to his family as a bunch of turtles), but it sometimes make sense.

Jokes aside, turtlers are not exactly a type of character, but a type of player. That is, a turtler is a player who tend to block attacks a lot.

Charge characters (ie. those whose repetoire of moves are mainly charge moves) generally fall into this category, as it is often that they need to remain in a blocking position in order to get their charges and counterattack.

Over the years, there have been many incentives to stray away from this style (as well as derivatives thereof, such as ticking), such as guard breaks, overheads, low attacks, shorter charges and unblockable moves.

Granted, the turtler is not as big as a factor as it used to be (the most popular character in "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" was Guile because of his turtling and ticking abilities), but Okina's reference to turtles remains.

Kagami, of course, continues SNK's tradition of making cheap-ass characters for final bosses.


Akari and Juzoh are the comedic relief characters in the Gekka series: Juzoh is seen in Akari's stage if Akari is fighting (and obviously, if Akari is not fighting Juzoh). Likewise, Akari can be seen in Juzoh's stage if Juzoh is fighting (and if Juzoh isn't fighting against Akari).

* On each level, a trio of statues arranged in a triangular pattern will appear about three-quarters of the way through. Bomb them until one of them reveals a passageway (you'll have to bomb them all; it's not the same one every time), and fly into it. You'll now be in a cave, free to fly along and collect treasure chests worth 200 points apiece. When you're in the cave, though, don't shoot - if you fire and hit a treasure chest it's destroyed, and some of the cavern walls release enemies when shot.

Lunar Lander (c) 08/1979 Atari.

Game ID: 0345xx


- TRIVIA -


Atari's first vector game. Lunar Lander was inspired by "Moonlander", which was written by Jack Burness in 1973 as a demo for the DEC GT40 vector graphics terminal (based on a PDP-11/05 CPU). This game used a light pen to control thrust and rotation. If you landed at exactly the right spot, a McDonalds appeared. The astronaut would come out, walk over to the McDonalds and order a Big Mac to go, walk back and take off again. If you crashed ON the McDonalds, it would print out 'You clod! You've destroyed the only McDonald's on the Moon!' After a short run of Lunar Lander machines were manufactured, production was shifted over to Asteroids and the first few hundred Asteroids machines were housed in Lunar Lander cabinets. Atari donated a gold edition version of the coin-operated video game to the Discovery Center of Science & Technology in Syracuse, New York. Approximately 4830 units were produced.


A Lunar Lander units appears in the 1984 movie 'The Philadelphia Experiment'.

Lupin III (c) 04/1980 Taito.

Game ID: LP


- TRIVIA -


Based, sort of, on Lupin III, one of the most famous manga/anime series of all time. Lupin is a descendant of Arsene Lupin, a thief who was the main character of mystery novels written by Maurice LeBlanc.  Monkey Punch (Katou Kazuhiko), Lupin III's creator, used the Lupin name without permission, and the estate of LeBlanc agreed not to raise too much of a fuss so long as Lupin III remained in Japan. This is why early US/European releases of Lupin titles changed his name to things like 'The Wolf' and 'Rupan'. The copyrights to the Arsene Lupin name have since passed into the public domain.


The Lupin III manga began in 1967, running in Manga Action. The first TV series began in 1971, and ran for 23 episodes. A second TV series began in 1977, and ran for 155 episodes. The first animated Lupin III movie (there had already been an old black-and-white live-action movie) was Lupin Vs. The Clones (more commonly known to US/European audiences as 'Mystery of Mamo') came out in 1978, and was followed in 1979 by the most famous animated version of Lupin, The Castle of Cagliostro. Footage from these two movies were used to make the laserdisc game Cliff Hanger. So Lupin was at the height of his popularity when this game was released.

Mad Alien (c) 1980 Data East.


Mad Alien is kind of a combination of a shooter and a driving game. You drive a car equipped with a gun on a road. The landscape around you shows different settings (cities, country side, tunnels) and scrolls by from the top to the bottom of the screen. Your enemies (mad aliens) drive in front of you in a galaxian-like formation and you have to shoot them. Watch out for mad aliens leaving the group and turning back to attack your car.

The Mad Alien machine had kind of a mini cabinet, which was rather uncommon for an arcade game. After the release of the dedicated Mad Alien machine, DECO made also a version of Mad Alien for their Cassette System.

Major Havoc (c) 11/1983 Atari.

Game ID: 136025


- TRIVIA -


Gameplay innovation at its finest. A game that would have done greater numbers had anyone cared in 1984. Only 500-600 dedicated machines were manufactured. If Owen had done Major Havoc in a raster version, which was suggested, it would have sold ten times as many. But unfortunately... the operators were getting very angry at vector games for failing all the time.


Mark Cerny came in the middle of the design, adding one of the space waves (the flying fish) and the last 4 base ship mazes. He also added some objects to the mazes (such as the gun and floating boots) and helped clean up old items that never got shipped.


A Major Havoc unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Warp Codes: It's possible to warp to higher levels in Major Havoc from the start of the game by using certain codes. This is useful to not only be able to get through the game more quickly, but each warp also gives a fairly hefty bonus for carrying it out. This is done by playing the mini-Breakout game at the bottom right-hand corner of the screen when the game starts. The game will have a phrase such as, 'Enter Red Warp 00' at the bottom of the screen. What you do is use the controls to 'dial in' the first digit of the appropriate code given below, then press fire to serve the ball and repeat as necessary. The codes are:

Red code - 23, 250,000 pts, Level 4.

Yellow code - 46, 600,000 pts, Level 9.

Green code - 824, 700,000 pts, Level 10.

Aqua code - 315, 950,000 pts, Level 13.


Note that you can only enter the codes in the order they're given - it's not possible to enter, say, the red warp code followed directly by the aqua warp code.

- UPDATES -


This version, unlike all other versions, uses a cross instead of a shield.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Turn Into A frog: As soon as you become a duck, shoot a tombstone 15 times in a row and an angel character will appear. This angel will fire a bolt at you. Let it hit you and you'll become a frog.


* Frog Bug Trick: Wait until the timer reaches 0:01 and then have the magician turn you into a frog, if he turns you into a frog as the timer runs out, Arthur becomes distorted (sprite broken) and the timer becomes crazy. But you can continue the play like this. :)


* Levitating Monsters: At level 6 (just after having beaten the big red guardian), kill the 5 skulls, then climb up the ladder to wake up the 2 doglike monsters. Go down again and walk right until you're blocked by the wall. Then wait for the monsters to stand just over you (possibly at the rightmost possible point), shoot at this very moment and it happens that they jump and remain in mid-air. It's not easy to do that, but you can manage to have both jumping and stuck. After that, you can safely climb up the ladder and walk while the monsters are moving above you without touching you. Don't shoot again, or they may jump up and go to the upper platform.


* Boss Tricks:

1) Dragon Trick - You can pass the level four dragon by fleeing! Just walk until music changes to boss theme (if you can't hear that, the spot is where you have the last two flames on the left of the screen), then go to extreme left: if everything is okay, the music should stop and the flames freeze. Go to the door to collect the key.

2) Demon Trick - To make disappear the demon boss at end of level five, try running away from him as fast as you can! Reach the floor with the hole in it and jump through it. If you have correct timing, you will fall in the pit, avoiding the moving platforms, and eventually escape the boss. Ogre boss tricks - The ogre bosses tend to jump when you fire, even if not directly at them. This is very useful in level six,when you can avoid losing your armor by activating the ogres, then going down the ladder and firing while holding your man in the same position where he starts at the beginning of the level.


* Other Tricks:

1) Weapon Trick - After having defeated a level boss(es),the knight can fire two or three "invisible shots"; if the man is facing the right border of the screen while doing so,the shots will reappear in the following stage. This can be exploited to kill some of the skulls at beginning of level six (soooo useful...).

2) Fire Bridge Trick - If the game difficulty level is not set to hard (you can check this by the zombies' speed), the fire bridge can be traversed by simply going right without stopping.

3) Weird Spots - In levels five and six there are spots where you can jump through the yellow rock background: usually getting blocked or killed. In level six, the floor below the bosses' has an invisible hole in it at the extreme left: this can be used to the player's advantage.

4) Cemetery Glitch - Reach the last tomb before the devil, jump it and go right two or three steps. The knight should now be in front of a tree on the background. Don't go any further - go back, instead. Climb the first ladder you'll meet, then climb down the one on the left, which shouldn't be completely on the screen if you peformed the trick correctly: surprise!

5) Warp Trick - This is very odd: by a strategy similar to the one to reveal the cemetery glitch (that is, fiddling with scroll), you can activate a 'level warp' in the platform section at the beginning of level four. It involves going right, then trying to have some platform carry you beyond the 'scroll stops' line on the left. This should kill the knight and possibly make the next life start on the fire bridge or in level 5.


* Armor:

1) The first armor is in the cemetery, between the red devil's starting position and last money bag: jump there to catch it. In the forest,there's the infamous unreachable armor: to collect it you should reach a spot just above the money bag right after the first plant. This cannot be done by jumping.

2) There are two armors in the ice palace. One can be gotten by walking left off the topmost platform; the other will fall right in front of the inferior plant by roaming around the other plant's location.

3) There are two armors in the blue cave. The first one is obtained by climbing the leftmost ladder and falling off the ledge. To get the second, perform a well-placed jump (you have to cross some precise point in mid-air while falling) before the fight with the last red devil.

4) The last armor is collected in level six by simply walking right on the first floor with hulk-like monsters on it (The programmers thought you couldn't avoid getting hit by the ogres and so they didn't hide that armor).

Mappy (c) 03/1983 Namco.


- TRIVIA -


Licensed to Bally Midway for US manufacture and distribution (03/1983).


This game runs on the "Super Pac-Man" hardware but uses a newer video board wich supports scrolling.


Mappy is the first game from Namco to include the "ALL RIGHTS RESERVED" on the titlescreen.


The mapping of the level counters in Mappy is a little strange; after level 49, the level symbols in the bottom right corner temporarily stop updating, but the numerical level counter and the high score display both record the proper level. The level symbols then start displaying correctly again at level 100 and continues to display correctly until level 254. Level 255 morphs into Level 0. Then the game starts over again and becomes easy again for level 1.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Easter Egg:

1) Enter service mode.

2) Keep Left pressed to make the screen scroll left until the grid covers the whole screen.

3) Press the service switch 3 times (the one that adds a credit, not the one to enter service mode).

4) Keep Button 1 pressed and enter the following sequence: Left(x4), Start1(x6), Left(x3), Start2. '(c) 1983 NAMCO' will appear on the screen.


* Easter Egg 2:

1) Play the game and reach the third bonus round (the one after round 10).

2) Press Button1(x3), Start1(x3) and Start2(x3).

After the score of the bonus round is shown, this text will be added at the bottom of the screen: '(c) 1983 NAMCO ALL RIGHTS RESERVED'.

Marble Madness (c) 12/1984 Atari Games.

Game ID: 136033


Controlled with a trackball.


- TRIVIA -


Mark Cerny was only 17 years old when he joined Atari and designed Marble Madness. The game was designed as part of a contest Atari ran at the time, allowing outsiders to design a game. Mark was very well known for his game-playing skills and easily won the contest. Mark taught himself how to program in assembly language before joining Atari, so he fit right in. In 1984, Marble Madness was the first game for the new Atari System 1 harware and Atari Games demonstrated the technical superiority of this new piece of hardware with this outstanding game. It was the first game with such impressive Pseudo-3D-Graphics.


The original plans called for the trackball to be motorized and syncronize its spin with that of the marble, to simulate inertia.


Marble Madness was the first game with true stereo sound. It was the first game with a kind of film music, the music really supports the pictures and keeps the player in suspense. It seems to be the first game that hardly had any repetitive elements during the levels and that had a real 'end', the player could win against the machine.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Cancel The Timer: Begin a game and then hold down either the 1 or 2 player Start and press the 'service switch' twice. The first press will glitch the screen display slightly - the second will remove it and give you 99 seconds to complete the level. This method adds 60 seconds to the clock, after which the normal countdown will begin. The clock will not appear to be counting down during the first 60 seconds, probably because the 99-second display was overflowed by the extra 60 seconds added. This method can be used multiple times per level for virtually infinite play time.


* When you play 2 players, the winner of each level gets a bonus 5 seconds (I was better than my brother, so I'd always get the 5 seconds :D). If your opponent can make it as far as the silly race, that's an extra 25 seconds for the ultimate race, not to mention a possible extra 10 seconds with a wand. The opponent can also continue once (with the same time as the other player).


* This isn't really a trick, but some people don't realize it: On the practice race, don't move when you start, and after a few seconds, a ramp will appear that will slide away the ball.

- TIPS AND TRIKS -


* Hint 1: As often as possible, try to kill animals in groups. Any animal killed is worth 800 points (plus the 800 point bonus coin). If you kill two animals in a short time (approx 1 second), the first is still only worth 800, but the second animal is worth 1600 points, not just 800. For three animals, the points are 800-1600-2400. For four animals, the points are 800-1600-2400-3200. The point for a killed animal is never more than 3200. So if you were to kill 5 at once, the fourth and fifth animal would both be worth 3200.


* Hint 2: Use the 'POW' button when several animals are hittable and grouped closely. This will make it easier to get the 'Hint 1' points.


* Hint 3: You can kill the fireballs just like tipping the animals; wait til they are close to the ground and hit underneath them.

Marvel Super Heroes was released by Capcom in memory of 'Jack Kirby' (aka 'The King of the Comics') [1917 / 1994] who was the most influential and respected illustrator and creator of comic books, at least of the super-hero/adventure variety. He was so important that, with that field now in recession, some are saying that when Jack Kirby died, he took the industry with him.

Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes (c) 01/1998 Capcom.

Game ID: CP-S II No. 28


Fifteen characters from all walks of the Marvel and Capcom lineups tag-battle each other including loads of special assist characters.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and six buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the Capcom Play System II hardware (CPS II).


Rumors exist for the reason War Machine was in the roster instead of Iron Man (although Hyper-Armor War Machine in the game had similar moves with Iron Man). The most popular reason being that Capcom, at the time, did not have the rights to use the Iron Man character.


Strider's ending is a reference to that of the ending in his own game ("Strider")

Jin's ending is a reference to Gawaine's ending in "Cyberbots - Fullmetal Madness" (but with Jin taking the place of Gawaine, Onslaught taking the place of the Final Weapon of Destruction, Jin's headband taking the place of Gawaine's sword and Ryu taking the place of Jin).

Megaman's ending is a reference to what happens in his own games ("Megaman - The Power Battle") when he beats a boss.

Captain Commando's ending is a reference to the ending in his own game ("Captain Commando").


Suleputer released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Marvel Vs. Capcom OST - CPCA-1005) on 21/03/1998.


- UPDATES -


Most people probably already know that some of the characters names were changed in the American version (E.g., Rockman was changed to Megaman).

When they recorded the announcer's voice, she had to say both the original names and the American ones during the recording. But for some of the characters' names that were NOT changed, there were alternate pronunciations recorded.

For example, when you select Chun-Li in the Japanese version, the way the announcer pronounces 'Chun' rhymes with 'noon'.

In the American version, the way she pronounces 'Chun' rhymes with 'fun'. There is also an unused alternate pronunciation of Zangief (which sounds like 'Zain-geef') that can be heard in the Sound Test.


Megaman's 'Rock Upper' move in the Japanese version is called 'Mega Upper' in the US version, simply because the name of the character is different in Japan and the US.

Maximum Force (c) 02/1997 Atari Games.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the Atari Cojag hardware.


This game was the second developed by Mesa Logic for Atari Games and has often been described as an unofficial sequel to "Area 51" (the real sequel being "Area 51 Site 4").


The game shares many similarities with "Area 51" (secret rooms, hard drive etc.) but uses a more sophisticated sprite overlay system, which allowed the interactive element to have the same number of colours as the video. Maximum Force uses a 16Bit stream for the main video (instead of 15bit for "Area 51"). There's about 50 minutes of video on the 2 GB hard drive. However, despite the more realistic sprites, innocents still do not disappear when shot and actual gore content is far less than that of, say, Mortal Kombat - Maximum Force was a product of the era where games such as Doom were still being blamed for violent shootings in America and Atari Games wanted to maintain their 'good guy' image.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* A Trick: You can determine which direction the end of level boss will move before it even appears by looking at your score. If the hundreds digit is odd, the boss will move to the left. If it is even, it'll move right (the tens and units digits are always zero).


* One Million Points Bonus: On the violet continent, if you see a coelacanth fossil on the left side, go to the -right- side and shoot. Cleopatra appears - shoot her and you'll get a million-point bonus. The coelacanth may only appear on the third violet continent.


* 80,000 Points Bonus: At some points in the game you will see two columns of green arrows down the center of the screen. Concentrate on either the left or right column of these arrows, and try to shoot 16 in a row. You will be awarded an 80,000 bonus for doing this. The first time these appear, it is possible to get two such bonuses in a row (if there are not many enemies around!), and sometimes more if the level ends before the column has finished appearing. Later on there is a short column of only 16, so only one bonus is possible here.


* 50,000 Point Bonus: You've seen a big enemy that combines into parts. When you hear the tune it is about to appear, STOP SHOOTING (You don't actually have to stop shooting altogether, but if you hit part of the enemy before the center part flashes white the bonus will not work). Position your ship so that you are just underneath the center part of the enemy and wait for it to flash white. Once this has happened, shoot the center part several times: the enemy will be destroyed and you will be awarded the 50,000 point special bonus.

Megaman - The Power Battle (c) 10/1995 Capcom.


Have you ever pictured a Mega Man game that allows to skip all the platform elements and just grapple against the bosses? That's pretty much the main idea in this game! Choose from Megaman, Protoman or Bass and battle against classic bosses in the series. Features great 2-D graphics, solid control, and a nice use of strategy (since the right order of weapons will rid you of specific enemies in no time!).

* At the end of stage 1, a large plane rises in front of the player. If you stand .25 to .5 inches up from the bottom of the cliff, and line up so your bullets will hit just to the right of the plane's center, it cannot hit you with its cannon. This takes practice.

Metal Slug - Super Vehicle-001 (c) 04/1996 Nazca.

Game ID: 0201


A rebel army, with powerful weapons & war machines at their disposal, commanded by the evil General Morden seeks to take over the world, and is up to Marco Rossi & Tarma Roving, two seasoned soldiers to face impossible odds in order to defeat this threat as well as rescue the many hostages that are scattered across the battlefield so they can reward you with weapons to help you in your mission. Don't forget to look out for your most powerful weapon available: the fearsome Super Vehicle 001 (known commonly as the Metal Slug). Features funny 2-D graphics with superb color & shading, great music & sound and classic run & gun action. Good luck soldier, your mission awaits...

Obviously parodying the movie and TV smash hits 'Full Metal Jacket' and 'MASH', this game obviously does not take itself very seriously! The Rebel Army's flag is an obvious parody of the Nazi army's flag. Also General Morden himself is a parody of Saddam Hussein!


Just as the two main heroes (Marco & Tarma) appear on every chapter in this game series, General Morden & Allen O' Neill (the machine gun wielding, trash mouth-talking, buffed soldier) are the classic main villains! (Quite a bunch of stubborn fellows, no?) :)

Nevertheless, the brave soldier team (Marco, Tarma, Fio & Eri) will risk their lives to rid the earth of the alien menace once & for all!

The underwater stages seem to be inspired in the old arcade title "In the Hunt", an intense submarine shooter by Irem (a case of nostalgia by the developer team?).


Lots of movie parodies in this game, check them out:

The crab mutants in Mission 1 are a parody of either the sci-fi horror movie: 'Deep Star Six' or the more popular sci-fi action flick: 'Starship Troopers'.

The overall setting and the zombies in Mission 2 could be a funny parody of either the horror classic 'Night of the living dead' or Capcom's famous survival horror videogame series 'Resident Evil'.

Also in this stage there is a guest appearance by the Men in Black! :)

The carnivorus plant aliens in Mission 4 seem to be a parody to the sci-fi musical comedy movie: 'The Little Shop of Horrors'.

The squid-like aliens in the gigantic Mission 5 (known as Mars People) continue to be an homage to the movie: 'Independence Day'.

Also the alien clones you face in this stage seem to parody the sci-fi horror movie: 'Invasion of the body snatchers'.

Finally, the last boss battle seems to be slightly inspired in the ending sequence in the sci-fi thriller: 'Alien Resurrection'.

One of the hostages (who also appeared in Metal Slug 2 & X, by the way) known as Hyakkutaro will join the fight by shooting fireballs! (possibly an homage to the famed Dragonball anime?)

This update also implements a few changes to beef up the game such as new enemies, a different end boss layout, a few cool new weapons and lots of secrets. The result is a better game & one of the finest chapters in this series. Who says you can't teach an old war dog some new tricks?! :)

Mikie (c) 10/1984 Konami.

Game ID: GX469


- TRIVIA -


This game is known in Japan as "Shinnyuushain Tooru-Kun".


The classroom level of Mikie plays the song 'A Hard Day's Night' by The Beatles. The Gym Level plays 'Twist and Shout', the Medley/Russell song made famous by the Fab Four.


- UPDATES -


* Shinnyuushain Tooru-Kun: This is the original version. Mikie has red hair (because we all know that redheads are temperamental troublemakers). Football players are now Bulky Students (Classroom) or Police/Probation Officers (Garden). All of the students wear uniforms, including Mikie. Your classroom teacher wears a white shirt and is somewhat pudgier than his American counterpart. Many of the rooms also have a slightly different appearance and I believe the dance studio teacher wears glasses. Go figure.


* Mikie (High School Graffitti): Aside from the noticeably different decor in the homeroom (all right, it's only the blackboard), there are several MAJOR differences in this MUCH harder version. Hearts that were normally in glass cases are stacked as piles of three hearts (you only have to time the last heart for Perfects). Furthermore, you can't headbutt in this version, you have to yell, which temporarily stuns enemies EXCEPT FOR your homeroom teacher, who cannot be stopped except by thrown items. Yelling is also much shorter range than headbutting, making timing crucial. Not a version for the weak-reflexed. Most importantly though is that if you take too long in a room, the Classroom teacher can throw what looks like either a necklace or dentures at you. On the plus side, you recover faster from a yell than a headbutt (less lag time) and enemies don't speed up as fast as they do in the other romsets (unfortunately, it seems as though the homeroom teacher will speed up on his own in this romset).

Missile Command (c) 06/1980 Atari.

Game ID: 035820-035825


- TRIVIA -


A hack of this game is called "Super Missile Attack".


Missile Command, was an immensely popular arcade game that combined great game play with a rather chilling message about the dangers of war. Approximately 20,000 units were produced.


Originally called 'Armaggedon', Missile Command was designed at a time that the United States and Russia were locked in a fierce 'cold war'.


* The Creation of Missile Command: The idea for Missile Command began with a magazine story about satellites that captured the attention of Atari's president, who passed the clipping to Lyle Rains. Rains asked Dave Theurer to lead the effort in creating the classic, action-packed arcade game.


* Remembrances from the Video Game Masters: Recalling the birth of Missile Command, Dave Theurer said: "The request was for a game where there are missiles attacking the California coast and the player is defending the coast. They said, take it from here and write up a game proposal. In the first proposal it was the California coast. "Part of creating a great game is knowing what to strip away. Some of the first baggage the developers dropped was geographic identifications because of the frightful scenario of the game. And then they stripped away more. Dave Theurer: "The original suggestion was for there to be a scanning radar, but I immediately said, no way! It would be just too hard for the player because he wouldn't be able to see what was going on. We chucked that idea. And when we first developed the game, we added railroads to transport missiles from the cities to the missile bases. That got to be too complicated and people got confused... if you get too complicated, people won't play. We also had submarines for a while but that didn't work out so we ripped them out, too.".


The smart bombs presented the most difficult challenge in writing the code for Missile Command. Dave Theurer: "These little diamond-shape guys can evade your explosions. The only way you can kill them is if the explosion starts out right on top of them. Programming that was the hardest part. They had to be intelligent because the little guy had to look around on the screen to see what he had to avoid and he had to figure out the best path to go around what there was to avoid. Of course, if I made it too smart, then the player couldn't kill it and they'd be guaranteed instant death. So it had to be a fine line between smarter than the dumb missiles, yet not totally unkillable.".


Nerves of steel is the way Rich Adam one of the Missile Command team members described his coworker: "Dave Theurer was extremely detail oriented, very thorough, very disciplined. He had nerves of steel, would never get rattled, and worked tirelessly. You need nerves of steel because if your code doesn't work it's your fault, something inside that code is not correct. There's really nowhere to hide. The real Achilles' heel with a lot of software people, I  believe, is that they spin their wheels and they go through this denial phase: 'It can't be my code! How could anything possibly be wrong with it? My code is so straightforward!' Well, it's so straightforward you might not have thought of a nuance. So, that's why it takes nerves of steel, I think. The work requires sort of a cold, methodical approach to the software."


* Popular from the Start: Even before it shipped, Missile Command had intense fans. Speaking of the play the game got just within the labs of Atari, Ed Rotberg said: "There were guys there that would literally have to worship that game for hours at a time. Their hands were sweating, and it was a definite adrenaline rush." Describing some of the dedicated players at Atari, Dave Theurer said: "We were in the same building as the consumer division and there were a couple of guys from that division who would  come down and spend all day playing Missile Command. I don't know what they did upstairs, but they would spend the entire day playing the game."


* The Great 25-Cent Escape: The escape from reality could sometimes have frightful consequences. The horrifying subject matter of Missile Command had an impact on the developers. Dave Theurer: "It was pretty scary. During the project and for six months after the project, I'd wake up in a cold sweat because I'd have these dreams where I'd see the missile streak coming in and I'd see the impact. I would be up on top of a mountain and I'd see the missiles coming in, and I'd know it would be about 30 seconds until the blast hit and fried me to a crisp.".

Steve Calfee: "Everybody I know who really got into the game had nightmares about nuclear war.". The game was nearly shipped with a name that carried the message of the end of the world... Armageddon. Steve Calfee: "We had this big thing about the name of the game. From the beginning, it was called Armageddon. The management, themselves, didn't know what the word meant and they thought none of the kids would. Then we went through this big thing of naming it. Engineering loved the name Armageddon, and we always wanted to call it that. From the very top came the message, 'We can't use that name, nobody'll know what it means, and nobody can spell it.'" Placing the game in the context of the previous decade, Ed Rotberg said: "The thing about Missile Command is that the world was not nearly as stable politically as it is now. There is a little bit of a  spooky message in that whole game when you have that final cloud at the end.".


A Missile Command unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1991 movie 'Terminator 2 - Judgment Day' and in the 1995 movie 'Species'.


In 1982, a multi-player sequel was planned but never released. This game would have have been identical to the first except with twice as many cities and batteries and the players cooperating to save each other cities from the onslaught.


In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including: "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hint 1: When alien ships fly over, keep adjusting your speed or they will eventually hit you with a bomb. Draw their bombs to one end of the screen, then shift to the other.


* Hint 2: Although the part of the mines seems to be the more difficult, it isn't - all you have to do is not move your tank at all, only pressing the jump button. You won't get many bonus points, but at least you'll survive.


* Hint 3: The big key to this game is memorization. After the beginner course, you go on to the champion course, which never changes no matter how many times you pass it. Memorize the two courses, and you will almost never lose a life.

Moriguchi Hiroko no Quiz de Hyuu! Hyuu! (c) 05/1995 Taito.

Game ID: E08


- TRIVIA -


The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Hiroko Moriguchi's Rushing Wind Quiz!' (Hiroko Moriguchi is the hostess' name). 'Hyuu-hyuu' is Japanese onomatopoiea for rushing wind.


This game runs on the Taito F3 System hardware.


The attract mode intro pretty much reproduces the intro format of Japanese broadcast television shows exactly, right down to having a screen for the sponsor's name (Taito, in this case) written underneath the word 'Teikyou' (all in white text) while an announcer says 'Kono bangumi wa Taito no teikyou de okurishimasu' which translates to 'This program is brought to you by the sponsorship of Taito'. Replace the word 'Taito' with the name of any other company and you have a phrase (or some variation of it) and text that is uttered and shown at the top of every single Japanese TV show broadcasted.


Hiroko Moriguchi is a pop singer and TV personality.

Mortal Kombat (c) 07/1992 Midway.


The original digitized fighter, infamous for introducing large sprays of blood and fatalities. Seven selectable characters and two end bosses pound each other into pulp and take an occasional break to throw in a bonus round.


- TRIVIA -


A bootleg version of Mortal Kombat exists, where the name of the manufacturer is YAWDIM - that's MIDWAY reversed!


This game runs on bot Williams / Midway Y Unit and Midway T Unit hardware.


The original concept of Mortal Kombat was modeled after the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie 'Bloodsport', which is a cult classic martial arts film. The character of Johnny Cage is directly modeled after Frank Dux, Van Damme's character in the movie. Johnny Cage's film-star motif is an obvious link to this. Cage also wears the same costume (plus shoes) that Van Damme's character wore in the final battle of the movie. Cage's splits punch was originally seen in Bloodsport during the fight against the Sumo wrestler. Since Midway was unable to get Van Damme for this game, they kept the same kumite/martial arts movie concept and added the Kombat story.


The code for this game includes the ASCII string 'NOOBSAIBOT' (originally in "Mortal Kombat II" rev. 3.1), suggesting that the character may have made his first appearance here, instead of Reptile (which took up less memory).


The heads used in the background of the first stage and in the spike pit are actually those of the programmers themselves! The statue of Buddha in the background of the courtyard stage was actually a lawn ornament from a neighbor's yard.


Liu Kang is Midway's homage to Bruce Lee.


A Mortal Kombat unit appears in the 1995 movie 'The Doom Generation'.

Mortal Kombat II (c) 11/1993 Midway.


Twelve digitized fighters battle to stop Shao Khan and Kintaro from dominating the Earth realm! Regarded as the best of the series.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the Midway T Unit hardware.


This game was the first Midway release to use the DCS Sound System.


'Noob Saibot' backwards spells 'Boon' and 'Tobias' who are the names of the principal game designers.


'Jax' was originally supposed to be in the original "Mortal Kombat" game and named Kurtis Stryker. Jax was then moved to MKII and the Stryker character debuted in "Mortal Kombat 3".


Two of the actors in Mortal Kombat were actually scholars at the time: Katalin Zamiar (Kitana/Mileena/Jade) left the project after MKII to study full time at university, while Phillip Ahn (Shang Tsung) is in fact a doctor.


SFII / MK2: both games were supposed to be released within weeks of each other (at this time, "Street Fighter" and "Mortal Kombat" were the dominant fighting games). Capcom released "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers" early so that they could attract fans away from MK. At the same time, Midway released MK2 early for similar reasons. As you can see, the result meant that both came back to square one.


'Friendships' and 'Babalities' (see 'Tips And Tricks' section for more info) in MKII were used in making light of the violence controversy in the first "Mortal Kombat" game.

A bootleg of this game is known as "Mr. Lo!" and another is called "Mr. Du!".

A hack is known as "Yankee DO!".


Inspired by "Dig Dug". The first of a series of four Mr. Do! games, this one was the biggest success. None of Universal's games did near as well as Mr. Do! and Universal disappeared in the video game crash of 1983-84.


- UPDATES -


On the Prototype version (which is a Japanese hack):

* You are a 'Yukidaruma' (a snowman) with green arms instead of the famous clown.

* You dig with a rake in your hands.

* There is a mean expression when you push an apple.

* The screen does not change colour when you grab cookies, cake, etc...


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* 255 Lives Tricks: It's possible to win 255 lives on the first screen, but only if an apple appears in the top two rows of the playfield.

1) Begin by digging a tunnel directly from the bottom of the screen to just below the apple, but leave enough dirt under it that it doesn't fall.

2) Next, kill all of the enemies but one, then lose all of your extra lives. As soon as you're on your last life, go right under the apple and wait.

3) Eventually, the remaining enemy will come after you. Allow the apple to drop, but, in the interval before you're squashed, kill the enemy with the powerball. If all has gone well, you'll be carried to the bottom of the screen, the music will go haywire for a moment, and you'll be awarded 255 extra lives.

4) Note that you should always lose a life before spelling 'EXTRA', or you'll roll back to zero lives, so, to be safe, immediately kill yourself at the start of level two.

5) IMPORTANT: This trick will only work with the Taito version of Mr. Do!.


* Here's A Neat Trick: You can divide the screen into a grid. The cheries, apples, and tunnel corners are all centered on a grid element. If you are being chased by the normal badguys (not ghosts) you can dig and stop between grid elements. The badguy will think it needs to turn into a digger to get you. While he's changing forms, you can escape.

This game runs on a "Pac-Man" based hardware.


Some hacks are known as "Ms. Pacman Plus", "Ms. Pac Attack", "Ms. Pacman Champion Edition" and "Pac-Gal".


Having won their enhancement kit lawsuit against Atari, General Computing went to Bally Midway and showed them an enhancement kit that they were working on for Pac-Man called Crazy Otto. Crazy Otto was a character similar to Pac-Man with the exception that he had legs. GCC was going to bluff Midway into letting them release their enhancement kit by telling them that they won their lawsuit against Atari, and that they just wanted Midway's blessing. Midway suggested that they create a sequel to the original "Pac-Man" instead of an enhancement kit, and GCC got to work on Ms. Pac-Man. Ms. Pac-Man had two prior names before settling on the one that everyone knows. 'Mrs. Pac-Man' was the original, but some of the women employees at Midway had a problem with that, so it was changed to 'Miss Pac-Man'. When someone pointed out the third intermission, where Pac and Ms. Pac welcome "Jr. Pac-Man" (or Baby Pac-Man) into the fold, they changed it to the final name of Ms. Pac-Man. Midway released Baby Pac-Man as a pinball/video hybrid, and General Computing sued the company, claiming they had created the concept of a Pac Family. They won the suit and were awarded royalties from Pac Family merchandise.




After the 255th level, the maze (including dots) disappears. The game becomes unplayable, since there are no more dots to eat.


A Ms. Pac-Man unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1984 movie 'Tightrope' (the cab appears in the background of the bar scene), in the 1990 movie 'The Grifters' and in the 2002 movie 'Van Wilder'.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Secret Message: The message 'GENERAL COMPUTER CORPORATION Hello, Nakamura!' is buried at the end of the Ms. Pac-Man ROM image (Masaya Nakamura was head of Namco).

This game is known outside Japan as "Ganryu".


This game runs on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware.


On April 14th, 1612, Musashi defeated the famous - and some think superior - fencer Sasaki Ganryu Kojiro using a simple wooden sword which he carved from a boat oar on the way to the duel. Musashi had an opportunity to see Kojiro's sword sometime before the duel and knew of it's great length. Musashi carved the wooden sword to be of greater length. When Musashi arrived on the beach for the duel, he kept the wooden sword hidden behind him until the duel began. He jumped over a low strike of Kojiro, reaching about a meter off the ground and came down hard on Kojiro's head with his heavy wooden sword. Kojiro lay dying on the sand and Musashi left in a hurry without killing him. Some of Musashi's critics call him a coward for not killing him, but Musashi had proved his point as the killing of Kojiro was not the goal - defeating him was. This is why the Kojiro character in Musashi Ganryuki has a huge gash on his forehead. The storyline of Musashi Ganryuki is that Kojiro has come back from the dead to try and kill Musashi.

NARC (c) 12/1988 Williams.


No one had the guts until now. Max Force and Hit Man take to the streets and drug labs to topple the crime empire of Mr. Big. Body parts go flying when the rocket bombs fire and you can arrest all of the crooks you want. Beware of the PCP-infused Dumpster Man!

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and four buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the Williams Z Unit hardware.


NARC was the first arcade game to use a 32-bit processor (TI 34010).


The second player character was a part of Acclaim's (who made the NES version of NARC) 'Power Team' along with Tyrone ("Arch Rivals"), Kuros (Wizards and Warriors/Ironsword), Bigfoot (the monster truck) and Kwirk the tomato, in an animated series featuring the characters. Three of the NARC bosses: Mr. Big, Dr. Spike Rush and Joe Rockhead were the villains on the series.


A NARC unit appears in the 1990 movie 'Don't Tell Her It's Me', in the 1990 movie 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' and in the 1991 movie 'Terminator 2 - Judgment Day'.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* While coming out of any door, move the joystick Left. IMMEDIATELY after your character appears, move the joystick Up. If you do everything correctly, your cop will be 'stuck' to the wall, and will be able to walk on the wall to the next stage.


* A specific Ase For The Same Trick: An easy way to get free lives is on the first level. Right after you leave the subway, keep your joystick pointed up. If you do this, you will "stick" to the wall and nobody can touch you, though you can arrest tons of people (50 is the max). You can do this in other levels, though it does not seem to be as useful. One problem occurs right when you get out of the subway. There is a barrel which obstructs your path in/on the wall. You can just rocket it away if there are people behind the barrel (in respect to you). You can stay on the wall all the way to the passkey spot and into the door.


* To get ridiculous numbers of points and, thusly, free men, you need to get to the end of the game, or at least where Mr. Big is. Once you've killed him (the little one *and* the big one), and you get to enter the treasure vault, just collect all the big gold blocks, and just wait. Don't do anything, just wait. After a while, the machine will send a pack of those annoying dogs after you. Let them kill you. You'll be sent back a stage in the game. And you have to fight your way back to the next 'bonus' exit door... once you do, mega-points and mega-men.


* Note the automatic teller machines present in a few places. March your character up to the machine and push into it; it should start spitting out money (evidence). Not HUGELY useful, but it's still kind of neat.

NBA Jam Maximum Hangtime (c) 11/1996 Midway.


- TRIVIA -


Maximum Hangtime was a chipset upgrade for "NBA Hangtime" that Midway sent out in late 1996 as a combination bug fix/game enhancement. "NBA Hangtime" came out in the spring of 1996, so by that fall, the new NBA season was starting up but the game was a bit old.


Differences between 'Hangtime' and 'Maximum Hangtime':

* New rosters for 1997 season including player trades and college rookies.

* Hot spots: Each player has a hidden spot on the court where they are more accurate. You'll know you're on it when a pulsing circle appears at your feet and you hear a sound effect from one of Turmell's favorite games, "Robotron - 2084". The announcer usually mentions the hot spot as well.

* No trivia contest. :(

* There's no code for the outdoor court - Simply press Left or Right on the joystick during 'Tonights Matchup' to choose Stadium or Outdoor.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and three buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware.


NeoGeo Cup '98 is actually a hack of "Super Sidekicks 3" made by SNK themselves. His subtitle is a homage for "Fatal Fury 3 - Road to the Final Victory"


A serious bug: Using a USA bios rom if you insert a coin on the 'winners dont use drugs' screen on a single slot the games will use the neogeo bios s1 tileset rather than the game tiles, this causes most of the graphics to be hidden and the games to be unplayable, it will also end up using the mainboard z80 bios so sound will be broken, the games should fix themselves if you let them run another attact loop after gameover, on a multi-slot the games will reset. This is one of the first 4 'gigapower' games, the bug was fixed after that.

* Besides the picture of Harlock in the background, nothing else in the 'Arcadia' game really has any relationship with the movie at all.

* 'NY, NY' came first and was then slightly modified to cash in on the 'Arcadia' movie. There are also no additional copyright notices, as there would normally be in a game based on a movie (So perhaps it wasn't even officially licensed).

* Another odd thing is that in Arcadia it really doesn't make a lot of sense to have a giant cyan Capt. Harlock floating around in space in the background.

* Whereas in NY, NY it actually makes sense for the Statue of Liberty to be in the background.

The New Zealand Story (c) 1988 Taito.


'Tiki' began a journey to rescue 'Yu Yu' and other friends who were snatched away by a leopard seal in the north island.


- TRIVIA -


The hero of this game, Tiki the kiwi, also appears in other Taito games like "Liquid Kids" and "Bubble Symphony" as a guest star.


Zoological note: A Kiwi in reality is a brown, non-flying bird, about the size of a chicken, that looks like it's got hair instead of feathers, and doesn't look much like the one in this game. It's also very rare, lives only in New Zealand and is a protected species.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Teddy Bear Cheat: In the demo mode during the attract mode, press fire 3 times and a cute picture of a bear will appear in the left bottom of the screen.

Newpuc2 (c) 1980 Kamiya.


- TRIVIA -


This game is a hack of "Puckman".


- UPDATES -


Newpuc2 has:

* Intermissions from the original "Puckman" between each maze

* A 'slot machine' every 3 mazes which determines which type of maze (invisible/visible) will come up next.

* The dots are worth 20 points, energizers 80.

* The bonus fruit start at 1000 points for the cherry and work their way up to 5000 from there.

* The monsters are worth 200, 400, 800 and 8000 points when eaten in succession.

* There are two maze variants: The first is a visible blue maze with five exits on each side and a modified maze layout from the original "Puckman". The second maze is invisible except for the borders and the dots, but has a slightly different layout than the visible maze and has only three exits on each side.

* When an energizer is eaten, the ghosts turn into different looking monsters.

* Instead of 'GAME OVER', it says 'MADE BY KAMIYA'.

Baseball Stars - Be a champ! (c) 1989 SNK.

Game ID: B9


- TRIVIA -


Licensed to Nintendo for distribution.


Baseball Stars became a major hit in many countries world-wide. It was one of the first sports games to have data memory, therefore players could pick a team and make a season, while being able to save season statistics. Baseball Stars was also the first sports game to bring the 'Create a player' feature. Gamers could, for the first time, create players and name them after themselves, family and friends, in addition to naming their own teams. Although the game did not use any names of real life baseball players, one of the computerized teams, the 'American Dreams', included players with nicknames such as Pete (Pete Rose), Hank (Hank Aaron) and Ruth (Babe Ruth).

- TRIVIA -


Kazuhisa Hashimoto, who programmed this Nintendo Famicom port, found the original arcade game too hard, so he inserted the so-called Konami code (See Code & Secrets section).


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Continue: At the Game Over screen press Down, Up, B, A, B, A, B, A, Start.

Note This can only be used once per game.


* Classic Konami Code: Press Start during the game, then press Up(x2), Down(x2), Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Start. This code equips you with two Missiles, two options and a force field barrier.


* Secret Message: During the title screen hold B+A, then reset the machine and return in the game (always with B+A) to get the following message: KONAMI ONE, GRADIUS ONE.

Megaman III (c) 1990 Capcom.

Game ID: XU


Contenders blast Megaman, in his search for energy Crystals, through a galaxy of mining stations controlled by ruthless robots. An amazing 21 different levels of rapid fire help Megaman battle against these armies of metal maniacs to gain their super powers. But the rebellious robots won't give up without using every android-annihilator known to Megaman. That's when players call on Rush, the wonder dogdroid, for special mechanisms that speed them past danger and assist in enemy melt-down. It's man vs. metal as players have more fun than humanly possible.

Super Mario Bros. (c) 04/1986 Nintendo.

Game ID: SM


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Warps:

1) Warp to World 2, 3, or 4: In World 1-2, boogie over the end pipe by walking on the ceiling and behind the wall you'll find a Warp Zone where you can warp to World 2, 3, or 4.

2) Warp to World 5: In World 4-2, walk on the ceiling like you did in 1-2 and you'll find a Warp to World 5.

3) Warp to World 6, 7, or 8: This is the second Warp Zone you can reach from World 4-2.

After the first elevator lift, there is a pit and three brick blocks above you. Jump around and you'll find four hidden coin blocks under the three bricks. Use the hidden blocks you just uncovered to hit the first brick which will sprout a Vine. The Vine leads to some Coins and the second Warp Zone.


* The World -1 a.k.a The Minus World (Note: You must be either big or have fire power to do this): Go to the end of world 1-2, where all the elevators are. Go past the elevators, but before the warp zone. You should see a horizontal warp pipe that leads outside. Don't go in this pipe. Instead, jump on top of it. Now, break the two rightmost bricks above you, but not the one that is touching the green pipe! Now, stand on the pipe, but as far left as you can go without falling off the pipe. Now duck and jump up. In the air, make sure you hold right as hard as you can, but stay ducked. If you accidentily break the brick that is touching the green pipe, then you can't do it. Keep trying this, it will take many attemps to accomplish. When you finally do it successfully, Mario will get sucked into the wall and start 'moonwalking' through it. While you are moonwalking, don't touch any buttons except for the joystick. If you try to jump, you will go through the top wall, and you'll have to do it all over again. When you are done moonwalking, you'll come out the other side. On the other side, there will be three warp pipes. Enter either the leftmost or the rightmost warp pipe before the screen scrolls all the way to the right. If done successfully, a screen should now appear which will say you are on world -1.


* The Double Jump: After grabbing a Mushroom in mid-air, Mario can pull off another jump with the right timing. First, time a jump so that small Mario is on his way down when he grabs a Mushroom. While Mario is transforming, hold A and he'll jump again when his transformation into Super Mario is complete.


* Continue: When you get a Game Over screen, hold down A and press Start. You will start on the first level of the world you died on.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Warp Vases:

1) World 1-3: There is a warp vase by the brick wall. Bring a potion and drop it on top. Go down the vase in subspace to warp to world 4-1.

2) World 3-1: Fall down the giant waterfall and make sure you land in the center on top of the door when you reach the bottom. The potion there is under the 6th grass from the right. Drop it on the vase in that room. This goes to world 5-1 (best place for coins).

3) World 4-2: Get a potion in the whale section and work your way right to the vase. This goes to world 6-1.

4) World 5-3: If you have Luigi, then you could easily jump to the top at the beginning of this world to get the potion next to the vase. Go down and this takes you to world 7-1.


* Get The Music From SMB1: Make sure that when you collect 5 cherries and the star comes up that you have a potion very close to you (even in your hands is good). Before getting the star, drop the potion so the door appears. Get the star and go into the door to subspace. You will hear the subspace music playing (from SMB 1) but you know that the music stops once you leave subspace. When the invicibility starts wearing off and the character starts to flash, exit subspace through the door and if you did it right, the subspace music repeats when you're back to the normal world. But this time it continues like the SMB 1 music. This lasts until you go into a door or lose a life. The best place to try this is World 1-3 at the beginning with all the cherries. This trick is not too hard to do.


* Suicide: Pause the game, then hold UP+A+B on the player2 side. Unpause and your character will instantly die and have to restart the level.


* Suicide Door: While entering a door, pause the game before the screen changes. Enter the suicide code (UP+A+B on the player2 side), then unpause the game. Instead of dying once, you'll watch your character fall through the floor and die for each extra life remaining! Game over.

Orbit (c) 11/1978 Atari.

Game ID: 033689-033702


- TRIVIA -


On Orbit, Owen was basically asked to knock off Steve Russell's 'Spacewar!' (the first vector video game ever writen: 1962!) in RASTER for the European market in just 6 to 8 weeks, it was done quickly and there are small mistakes. Owen should have made the shots bigger for example, and the space stations could have had better graphics. But for a raster version of an original vector game in those days, Atari hit it fairly well.


There was 2 versions, a large upright cabinet (that may never have been shipped) and the smaller one with the long row of buttons. Atari did a very advanced version in the larger cabinet that had an electronic touch pad and lots of LEDs to indicate which options were selected, with a different type of buttons from the small cabinet. It was a very cool touch pad but all the same functions were there, just in a small space. It was a large cabinet with the touch pad over the monitor. The stereo sound was cool because it placed the sound where the objects were on the screen.


Owen also changed the option buttons to always work because he hated that in 'Spacewar!', once you picked the game and options, you were stuck with them for the entire game. If you bought and were playing a 15 minute game, it was a long time to realize you should not have picked negative gravity! Also, Owen needed to add something to the game to make it different (in addition to the switchable options), so the idea of getting new fuel, shots, and repairs from Space Stations seemed like a cool idea at the time. Too bad it did not work as well as Owen thought it would. That is why they are an option.


The last interesting note on Orbit was that the space stations actually DO orbit the sun, they are not on tracks. Owen gave them an initial hit of velocity at the start of each wave and the gravity routines do the rest (they ignore negative gravity, because the first time you selected it, they would fly off the screen). To test the gravity routines, on the bench Owen put the space stations into orbit around the sun, and just let it run for days. Several days later, they were still in orbit, but degraded a bit and a bit more elliptical. They finally lost orbit a few days later. Not that Owen needed to do this, he could have put them on tracks, but he wanted his 8 bit gravity math to work as well as possible all the other time.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Super Speed: Instead of just pressing the accelerator all the way when you're about to start, you should instead try to keep the gas in 'the high greens' and just below red. The exact moment the green light goes on you should give it as much gas as possible thereby starting up much faster. Instead of shifting at app. 170mph you should change gears at about 120 mph to avoid slowdown. This hint earns you app. 1 second. This trick works every time you have to start from 0 mph but is difficult to time right when you don't have the green light for timing.


* Secret Credit Message: Right before the road forks, press and hold Start. When you choose one of the roads and the other one disappears from view, a secret credit message will come up on the screen.


* Fatest Route: The fastest route for finishing the game is Right (Devil's Canyon), Left (Snowy Alps), Right (Wheatfield), Right (Autobahn).

- TRIVIA -


A hack of this game is known as "Hangly Man".


Pac-Man was first introduced to the arcades at the end of 1980. The voracious little critter caught the hearts and imaginations of the public like no other game and is the hallmark of the golden age of video games.


Developed by Namco, the game was called "Puckman" in Japan, but due to American's predilection with changing words to vulgarities by scratching part of the word off (Puck to...well, you know), it was changed to 'Pac-Man'. The name 'Pac-Man' is derived from the Japanese slang word 'paku-paku', which means 'to eat'.


Pac-Man was conceived at lunchtime...literally. The designer, who was 26 at the time, was very hungry and ordered a whole pizza for himself. He took one slice and Pac-Man was born. The game took 1 1/2 years to complete and had five people on its team. Pac-Man is the greatest selling arcade game of all time and is arguably the most well-known video character. It had its own cartoon, lunch box, board game and hundreds of other products. Pac-Man was also the first game to have a 'character' and changed the face of video games forever. Pac-Man was the first video game to be as equally popular to women as it was with men. Pac-Man's cult status in the early 80s was so great, it even inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Pac-Man Fever' released on the album of the same name.


* A place in video game history: "Pac-Man is the most universally known arcade game," said Chris Lindsey, director of the National Video Game and Coin-Op Museum in St. Louis. "Everybody knows about Pac-Man. And, I've noticed, most everybody can play Pac-Man pretty well. Pac-Man makes just about the best use of the joystick one can imagine. It's so intuitive that it puts other games to shame in terms of how easy it is for a person to walk up, stick a quarter in the machine, and start doing something meaningful. At the time, Pac-Man introduced a completely unique style of game play and was also highly identifiable in terms of its music. With Pac-Man, everything was there. The video game industry needs another game that captures the public's heart like Pac-Man, and so far, no one has been able to come up with it.".


* The great 25-cent escape: "People expect to see Pac-Man when they come into the museum, and without fail, when they see it, they want to play it," Lindsey said. "People remember spending hours and hours at Pac-Man. They like to see how good they are now when they play it. And I would say that, perhaps more than any other game, the same playing skills still apply. Perhaps it's because of the intuitive game play. You don't have to memorize the behavior of a wide array of enemies as you do with some other games. You just have to remember that when the ghosts turn blue, you only have seconds, until they start seriously blinking, to go and get them. And Pac-Man is a little bit looser in its style of game play -- more open. For instance, you can kill time in the lower left hand corner until you see an opening between the ghosts, and you can strategize a bit more: You can play with the tunnels, you can play with the position of the ghosts in relation to the energizers. Even people who haven't played in years remember those strategies.". After all these years, the challenge of Pac-Man still remains.

"You can also get into some really fun jams, when you've got a ghost on your tail and you have to make a decision about whether you're going to go left, or right, or straight at the next junction, which is in .03 seconds," Lindsey said. "It gets to be pretty tense, especially when those ghosts start moving really fast and the energizers aren't lasting as long. Pac-Man can be a real heart-thumping game.".


After the 255th level, Pac-Man locks up. This lockup does not occur if, at the end of level 254, the number '255' appears at any point within your score.


The alien spaceship "Galaxian" makes an appearance as a bonus item in the later levels.


Note: There are 240 dots per board.


Note 2: Excluding bootlegs there are 23 different name/nickname combinations for the ghosts in Pac-Man (24 including 'Sue' from "Ms. Pac-Man").


A Pac-Man unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Jekyll & Hyde... Together Again', in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1983 movie 'Koyaanisqatsi - Life out of Balance' and in the 1985 movie 'The Heavenly Kid'.


MB (Milton Bradley) released a boardgame based on this video game (Pac-Man Game) in 1982.


- UPDATES -


Midway's new revision program for Pac-Man was released in 12/1981, the new program increases the difficulty of the game and adds a new challenge to players already familiar with the original.


The bootleg version on "Galaxian" hardware has different colors and screen proportions. Credit, Level & Lives remaining are incoporated in the Maze section (look at the middle exits). The sound is also quite a bit different.

Pac-Mania (c) 11/1987 Namco.


The last Pac-Man game that strictly adheres to the classic "Pac-Man" gameplay of navigating an enclosed maze and avoiding ghosts (or eating them after eating a power pellet) with the goal of eating all the dots in the maze, all from a fixed overhead perpsective. Pac-Man is given the new ability to jump, but only within the path (so you can't jump over the walls to cut across the map, for example). You can use the new ability to jump over ghosts or over particular items to avoid eating them.

Pachinko Sexy Reaction (c) 1998 Sammy.


- TRIVIA -


The pinball-like game of Pachinko is extremely popular in Japan and can be found in many American casinos. The term Pachinko is derived from the Japanese word pachi-pachi, meaning the clicking of small objects or the crackling of fire. While the origins of pachinko are unknown, it most likely descended from the 'Corinth Game' which originated in Chicago, USA. The game appeared in Japan in the early 1920's and the first Pachinko hall was opened in the Osaka Prefecture. Takeichi Masamura is known as the founder of today's pachinko for he developed the 'Masamura Gauge', an arrangement of nails that became the basis for most of today's pachinko machines. In the 1980's pachinko machines became computerized and now have sounds and graphics that make the game more exciting. Pachinko is similar to pinball in that small 11mm steel balls are shot onto the playing surface where they haphazardly bounce around and through a network of nails. The object of the game is to have the balls directed into winning pockets, whereby you receive more balls that equate to a prize or a monetary amount. The pachinko player is only responsible for controlling the speed by which the pachinko balls are shot onto the playing surface, from then on it basically becomes a game of chance. To initiate play you insert money to purchase a number of balls that are dropped into a loading area. By pulling the handle-like knob, one ball is released and projected by a spring. Most of the balls will fall unsuccessfully through the pins to the bottom, but some will fall into special pockets that activate a slot machine. At this point you are instantly rewarded with a set number of balls and if the same three symbols match up on the reels, you win an even greater amount.

On Monday, June 30, 1986; Mr. Mark Caesar and Mr. Robin Hallingstad file a suit against Atari Games for $1 million plus profits alleging that the company stole the idea for a video game that was marketed by the name of PAPERBOY. The boys had submitted to Atari a detailed proposal for a similar game in July 1983.


After a score of 10,000,000 or more is achieved, the initial in the top 10 ranking merges with the score to produce a truly impressive score display. For example, if you had top score at 10,000,000, this would appear as "110,000,000"!

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* During the game three birds will attack all in a line. Let those birds fly all the way to the bottom and start to fly back up. As they are flying up, shoot all three in a row real quick (2 or 3 seconds) and you will get 200,000 points instead of 200 - The best way to get the 200,000 point bonus for shotting the three birds in a line is on the second stage of level 2. The blue and pink birds in an oval shape. Just wait, not firing at the bottom of the screen. A single bird will come down, fanny around and then fly back up, then 4 birds will fly down together in a line. When they start to fly back up - blast three of them for the bonus. It works best here because of the rapid fire allowed on this and every other 2nd stage. If you repeat the trick after succesfully doing it the first time, you lose 200, 000 points however - so make sure you only do it once !.

Felicia: Can disguise herself as Rockman ("Rockman - The Power Battle"), Rikuo / Sasquatch / Huitzil ("Vampire - The Night Warriors"), Gamof  & Rimgal ("Star Gladiator - Episode:I Final Crusade").

Ibuki: Among her costumes are Rolento (Street Fighter Zero) and Chaka ("Jojo's Bizarre Adventure").

Chun Li: She disguises herself as Jun May Williams ("Star Gladiator - Episode:I Final Crusade") & Jill Valentine ("Resident Evil").

Gouki: He disguises himself as Leo ("Warzard").

Also when performing his Shun Goku Satsu the old way (Punch, Punch, Towards, Kick, Special) he parodies Guy's Musou Renge Super Combo! (Street Fighter Zero).

Lord Raptor's graveyard makes a cameo in Gouki's ending!

Ken: Some disguises are a soccer player ("Capcom Sports Club") and Hol Horse ("Jojo's Bizarre Adventure").

Tessa: In one of her costumes she disguises as Midler ("Jojo's Bizarre adventure").

Also when she is low on energy and she blocks an attack she summons Pao ("Warzard") and uses her as a living shield!. :(

Morrigan: When performing her 'Darkness Ilussion' she summons her kid sister Lillith ("Vampire Savior - The Lord Of Vampire").

Hauzer: The huge monster who appears on Ryu's ending is a boss character in "Warzard".

Zanglief: His Leaping Bite super combo actually happens to be a parody of Birdie's Murder Chain super combo (However Zangief modifies the second part of the move by biting the opponent instead of slamming them on the ground as Birdie does!).

The 'Capsy' soft drink (seen in Felicia's ending) is a parody of the Pepsi cola!. :)


Additionally you can find lots of famous Capcom characters on the game's backgrounds, some of these are:

Blanka, Dhalsim & his wife Sari, E. Honda, M. Bison, Cammy, Fei Long, Guile, Charlie, Vega, Dee Jay, Birdie, Gen, Sodom, Guy & Rolento (Street Fighter games).

Rikuo & Riki, Victor, Bishamon, Jon Talbain, Hsien Ko (disguised as Santa Claus!), Sasquatch, Demitri, Jedah (as a woman!), Donovan & Anita, Baby Bonnie Hood, Lin lin (in the game's logo!) & Huitzil (Darkstalkers/Vampire Savior games).

Chris Redfield (looking quite pale & angry!), the giant snake boss (that is trying to gobble up Rikuo!) & a few zombies! (Resident Evil games).

Helena ("Street Fighter III - New Generation").

Vampire Mistress in Red Dress (seen in Demitri's stage in "Vampire Savior - The Lord Of Vampire").

Demitri's girlfriends (seen in his own stage as well as in his ending in Darkstalkers & Nightwarriors games).

Jun May Williams & Rimgal ("Star Gladiator - Episode:I Final Crusade").

Don Tacos ("Pang! 3").

Pao & Leo ("Warzard").

Son Gokuu ("Son Son").


All of the death scenes that occur when a character is defeated are taken from famous old games, such as "Son Son"'s 'splash down the drain' or the famous "Final Fight" / "Double Dragon" 'blink-out'.


The long-nosed karate character bearing a halo that appears with Dan during certain moves is Dan's father who was killed by Sagat. The long-nosed karate fighter is a hilarious parody of Mr. Karate, aka Takuma Sakazaki of the AOF/KOF series, who wore a long-nosed Tengu mask in the original "Art of Fighting" when disguised as the final boss.

You're the commander of a Polaris class nuclear submarine. Your mission is to defend your country from enemy attack. War has been declared and you find yourself deep in enemy water with no help. In your battle, you will be required to defend against wave after wave of enemy planes and dive bombers. To make things worse, the enemy has sent their own subs and destroyers. In the course of your battles, you will need to manoeuvre through dangerous channels full of mines. Don't expect a short war and the battles get rougher, how many of the enemy can you destroy before they get you.

Pole Position (c) 09/1982 Namco.


Controlled with a steering wheel, accelerator and brake pedals and a two-position gear shifter.


- TRIVIA -


Also licensed to Atari for US manufacture and distribution (11/1982). Approximately 20,400 units were produced by Atari (~17,250 Upright and ~3,150 Cocktail).


A bootleg of this game is known as "Top Racer".


When Pole Position was introduced in 1982, players lined up in arcades around the world to grip the steering wheel and stomp on the gas pedal of a driving game so realistic that the players -- just like their cars -- were swerving around the corners. Pole Position was a 14-carat contribution to the golden age of video games. Pole Position started the trend for photo-realism in video game graphics. In addition to great graphics, it had great game play and it was a huge success, dominated game charts for almost about 2 years.

This was the first driving game to be based on a real circuit: The action takes place at Fuji Speedway in Japan. The snow-capped Mt. Fuji appears in the background.


* A place in video game history: "Pole Position stands out as the racing game that really appealed to the general public," said Chris Lindsey, director of the National Video Game and Coin-Op Museum in St. Louis. "It went into arcades across the nation, where it can still be found. Pole Position machines were placed everywhere -- even in gas stations!". The popularity of Pole Position was based on its realism. Players felt as if they were actually in the driver's seat. "Racing games before Pole Position tended to have a top-down perspective in which you floated over the course, which wasn't terribly realistic," Lindsey said. "Pole Position's eye-level point of view gave it a great deal of realism, and this point of view became a standard for racing games that followed. In addition, it provided a lot of peripheral cues. You saw lots of things zipping by on the side of the screen and this really added to the excitement of the game. Pole Position also had great sound. You could hear the gears winding out in the stretches. As you zipped by another car, you could hear that car's engine. All of these details added to the overall effect. Pole Position was, and still is, an awfully nice game.".


* The great 25-cent escape: Chris Lindsey believes that a big reason why Pole Position has remained such a timeless classic is that it has always appealed to women, in addition to men. "I think there are quite a few game developers who would like to figure out why some games appeal to females," Lindsey said. "Perhaps this is just pop psychology, but I've seen two types of games women will take to: racing games, and games in which the character, or your representation on screen, is doing something besides destroying bad guys. I don't know if that's the correct way to describe it, but that is what I've seen. I've had occasion to work in different types of entertainment facilities, large and small, very modern and, of course, the museum. Without fail I see women take to "Pac-Man", and I see them take to racing games, almost regardless of what the racing game is.".

Lindsey said the comparative lack of violence in Pole Position and other racing games might explain their popularity with women -- as well as with men. "I think violence in games is fairly thoughtless for men, and for some women, the violence in a video game may stick out," Lindsey said. "Violence in gaming is not an experience that most people seek even though they like video games. When those people find games that are engaging, and that offer outstanding game play, there is a desire on their part to dive into it. These racing games really offer that.".


* Namco notes: The engineers who created Pole Position knew they had created something special when a steering wheel was first connected to the prototype game in their lab. Later, when Pole Position was released, engineers visiting the arcades found that the waiting lines were so long that they curled back and forth within the arcade and then extended out the door.


A Pole Position unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.


Parkers Brothers released a boardgame based on this videogame (same name): Players put various movement cards (move 5, move 4, move rookie/move 2, move 2/shift track) in an attempt to be the first car around the track.


- UPDATES -


Differences between the Namco and the Atari version:

* On the title screen, Namco's original version say '1LAP 4359M', Atari's version convert this in: '1LAP 2. 709mi.'

* At the start of the game, a Goodyear blimp carries the white banner across the screen in the Namco version while a blimp with the word 'Atari' carries the white banner across the screen.

* The white banner that flies across the screen in the Namco version says 'Yosen Start!' on it accompanied by a woman's voice that says 'Yosen Start desu'. It means 'Preliminary Start'. The Atari version has the white banner and a woman's voice say 'PREPARE TO QUALIFY'.

* There are billboards for "Dig Dug" and "Centipede" in Atari's version, instead of 'Marlhboro' and 'Pepsi' in Namco's version.

Power Instinct 2 (c) 04/1994 Atlus.


The Gougetsuji clan of Kurokos had finally found a new master after Otane Gougetsuji finally defeated the former leader, her older sister Oume. Unfortunately Otane has now dissapeared! So a new tournament is called out in order to quickly find a new clan leader. All the fighters from the first tournament have returned as well as some eager (...and strange!) newcommers. Featuring some of the funniest parodies of famous fighting games, a cool soundtrack an tons of new moves making it a way better game than its predecessor, there is no doubt that only the strongest will survive this battle!

The character Kurara is obviously a parody of the typical magic girl trend in Anime and Manga started with Mahou No Princess Minky Momo, Kurara has Momo's transformation from a little girl to a teenager; she is also a parody to the second series of Minky Momo as she is also from an underwater kingdom. Her voice actress is Kotono Mitsuishi, who happens to be the same one that voiced Sailor Moon, yet another popular magic girl. 'Kurara''s good transcription is 'Clara'. She also has her own arcade game: "Purikura Daisakusen" (Note: Princess=PURInsesu, Clara=KURAra, PURInsesu+KURAra=Purikura) - Japanese love abbreviations.

- TRIVIA -


Developed by Time Warner Interactive.


This game runs on the Atari GT hardware.


Atari had intended to create another upgrade for PR 2.3 and was scheduled at this time for January 1995. This upgrade would allow the player to face a boss monster at the end of the game for total domination of the world. The final boss was supposed to be a horned dracolich (animate dragon skeleton) imprisoned in the moon, with three claws on each limb and three spines on the end of his tail. It was also supposed to have the powers of flight and the ability to drain the opponent's lifeforce. The final battle ground would be a moon scene with the skeletons of numerous dinosaurs laying around in decaying states. The ground would be covered with craters and giant, glowing cracks. A teleportation warp would exist overhead. Unfortunately, Atari scrapped the idea for this upgrade because Time Warner Interactive been too busy at this time to work on an upgrade and the boss was never came into existence... :(


A line of toy action figures based on all seven characters of PR were made by Playmates in 1996.


Atari released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (All The Rage).


- UPDATES -


Here is the big list of version 2.3 changes:

* 100% health bug from ver 1.7 fixed.

* 'fatality'/'no fatality' music added; other music enriched w/more percussion.

* A previous high score drops to 2nd when beaten.

* All Leaping Attacks can be blocked.

* All Stomps can be blocked and/or done in the air.

* Armadon can volley his victim after the Mega Charge.

* Armadon, Blizzard, Talon slowed down.

* Armadon's Spinning Death and Mega Charge don't go under projectiles anymore.

* Blizzard's Freeze Breath inflicts damage; Freeze Breath & Ice Geyser don't last as long.

* Block-damage usually won't kill you.

* Chaos' Battering Ram makes an annoying new sound.

* Chaos' Cannonball finishing move can kill enemies on any stage.

* Combo names, Total Domination, Quick Kill features added.

* CPU's 'AI' patterns changed; many old tricks no longer work, but some new tricks do.

* Demo mode intro text has letters made of bones instead of black letters.

* Diablo, Sauron, most leaping attacks, most projectiles speed up.

* Diablo's Torch combos more easily.

* Diablo's Inferno Flash can be blocked.

* Eating humans adds much more energy to your health meter.

* Gameplay speed changed.

* Generally, damage to heart & brain meters decreased, but block-damage to heart increased.

* Gone are the faint 'blue shields' that used to appear when blocking attacks.

* Hop jumps can now be used vs the CPU.

* If you're on the ground, projectiles don't knock you down anymore.

* In free play mode, the words 'DEMO ONLY' appear & CPU can't hurt you.

* Little SF2-style 'Christmas Lights' added; they flash with every strike, blocked or not.

* One new fatality for each character added.

* Simultaneous attack collisions tuned: 'sweet spots' removed, quick->fierce->power->quick 'round robin' priority system added.

* Sudden Death lasts for 30 seconds instead of 20.

* Talon can attack (or be attacked) as he rebounds from the Brain Basher.

* Talon's low 4 is cheezey to use twice in a combo.

* Talon's Pounce & Flip does no block-damage.

* Talon's Shredder fatality made gorier.

* Vertigo has a new teleport and can do both old & new teleports in the air.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Alternate Costumes (vers. 2.3 only): Highlight a fighter at the character selection screen, then press 1+2, 1+3, or 1+4.


* Bowling: Both players must choose Armadon. Do the Spinning Death move and collide in mid-spin three times in a row. A bowling game will pop up.


* Volleyball: One player should do a multi-hit combo a worshipper will enter the area, hit him and they will fly in the air. The other player needs to hit the player before he hits the ground--toward player 1, if you keep this up for ten hits, the ref will bring out a volleyball net. Play for 3 pts.


* PR version: To check what version of Primal Rage your arcade has, push Up on player1 joystick and pull Down on the player2 joystick simultaneously, during the title screen.


* Raining Cows: Play as Chaos in his stage (the Ruins). Arrange for a 'Sudden Death' round to take place (If the third round ends without a clear winner [both characters have zero wins, or one win each], you both get knocked down and go immediately into a 'Sudden Death' round).

If you do a 'Fart of Fury' so that the green cloud is in the air as the Sudden Death begins, the sky will rain cows instead of meteors.

If you don't do an FoFury on Chaos' stage, the sky will rain bricks.

If Sudden Death occurs on Blizzard's stage, the sky will rain ice balls.

- TRIVIA -


A little game which did not have huge success, it nevertheless became a 'cult game' for many players thanks to the brilliant gameplay, hard-to-find secret bonuses and anime-like plot. The inspiration for the design of the five ESPers comes from several Japanese cartoons of the '70s where the physical aspect of main characters was strongly stereotyped to suit their psychological profile/fighting ability.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Secret Bonus: There is a secret bonus in every round. To get them, you must hit the right [?] (question mark box) when your score fits a certain qualification.

1) The first level 'secret' is near the first phone. You should jump on the wall between the two bowls, then jump up and to the left. You'll land near a [?]. If you are in the right place, a walking clock should appear within 2/3 seconds. You can get a secret bonus from this box if you hit it when the thousands digit of your score is zero. (e.g.: 00000, 10500, 20900). The first secret is worth 10000 pts.

2) The second level 'secret' is near the first phone (yes, like the first one). There are 2 [?]'s on the lower-left corner of your screen (when you are near the phone); the upper one is a 'normal' [?], but you have to destroy it in order to reach the other one. You can get the secret bonus by hitting it when the thousands digit of your score is 1. This is worth 50000 pts.

3) The third one is near a phone, again, and near the fishbowl too. When you can reach the upper-right corner of the screen, and 2 umbrellas are floating above you, THAT is the right phone. There is also an extra bonus somewhere near that. You should use the short boy or the little girl to reach the secret bonus - it's at the end of the "small corridor" where the other 2 guys (the tall one and the fat one) can't enter. To get it you should hit the [?] when the thousands digit is 2. This should be worth 100000 pts.

4) If you miss a bonus, the thousands counter for the next bonus is modified accordingly. In other words, the thousands digit of your score must always be equal to the number of times you have previously gotten the secret bonus. Thus the tips above are correct only if you are getting every secret bonus without missing any - otherwise, deduct the number you've missed from the thousandth digit needed. Clear as mud? ;)

5) The 'ALL GOLD' bonus. Very simple to explain, but hard to do: When you break a bowl, the item you find in it is the same as the previous bowl, if you don't use your hammer after you hit the first and before the second. If you do, instead, the item "shifts", and you find the "next" in the order. If you go on hammering, the "rotation" can bring the first item back again. The first level has 4 items, so if you 'shoot' 0/4/8/12/16... times after breaking the first bowl, you find the same item in the second one. This is true unless you already 'finished' an item, otherwise you should "shoot" 0/3/6/9/12... times to find the item twice.


* Get Espers Sooner: Normally you get Makoto in scene 3 and Genzoh in scene 5, but you can get the espers sooner.

1) Get the 'All Gold' bonus in scene 1 and you'll find Makoto in scene 2.

2) Get Makoto in scene 2 and get the Secret Bonus in scene 3 and you'll find Genzoh in scene 3.

3) Get the 'All Gold' bonus in scene 3 and you'll find Genzoh in scene 4 (if you have not gotten him in scene 3).

Psycho Soldier (c) 1987 SNK.

Game ID: 'PS'


- TRIVIA -


Psycho Soldier was the first-ever video game featuring a vocal soundtrack. The Japanese lyrics for the Psycho Soldier theme is also used as the Psycho Soldier team's team music in KOF94 and 96, as well as Athena's theme music in KOF 97 and 02.


Psycho Soldier's Soundtrack was released as a bonus with the purchase of Nintendo Famicom's Athena. It also included a vocal version of the ending theme.


The main character, Athena, appears in The King of Fighters series.

Kensu, wearing a different outfit, appears in The King of Fighters series as 'Sie Kensou'. Kensu, as he appears here in Psycho Soldier, appears as a striker character in "The King of Fighters 2000" as 'Psycho Soldier Kensou'.

Puckman (c) 05/1980 Namco.


A sensational maze game! The player must guide the Pac-Man about the maze, scoring points by munching up the dots in his path. Four ghost monsters chase after the Pac-Man trying to capture and deflate him.


- TRIVIA -


This game is known outside Japan as "Pac-Man".


A Bootleg of this game is called "Ghostmuncher".

Some hacks are known as "New Puck X", "Newpuc2" and "Joyman".


Puckman was first introduced to the Japaneses arcades market at the midle of 1980. The voracious little critter caught the hearts and imaginations of the public like no other game and is the hallmark of the golden age of video games.


Puckman was conceived at lunchtime... literally. The designer, who was 26 at the time, was very hungry and ordered a whole pizza for himself. He took one slice and Puckman was born. The game took 1 1/2 years to complete and had five people on its team. Puckman is the greatest selling arcade game of all time and is arguably the most well-known video character. It had its own cartoon, lunch box, board game and hundreds of other products. Puckman was also the first game to have a 'character' and changed the face of video games forever. Puckman was the first video game to be as equally popular to women as it was with men.


After the 255th level, Puckman locks up. This lockup does not occur if, at the end of level 254, the number '255' appears at any point within your score.


The alien spaceship "Galaxian" makes an appearance as a bonus item in the later levels.


Note: there are 240 dots per board.


Note 2: excluding bootlegs there are 23 different name/nickname combinations for the ghosts in Pacman (24 including 'Sue' from Ms. Pac-Man).

Puckman Pockimon (c) 2000 Genie.


A "Pac-man" style game with Pac-Man and Pocket Monster (Pok'n) characters. Player 1 controls Puckman and Player 2 controls Pikachu's head. Trying to catch you are the Ghost Monsters from the Pac-man games along with some Pocket Monsters. Get the 'power fruit' and you can eat them instead. When you complete a level, you are shown a digitized photograph of an Asian woman for some reason.


- TRIVIA -


The game's creators probably did not get permission from Namco or Nintendo to use the characters, since there are no copyright notices indicating otherwise. While 'Pockimon' is a misspelling of 'Pokemon', "Puckman" is "Pac-Man"'s original name in Japan.


Most of the sound effects and music were taken from "Ms. Pac-Man".

A Game & Watch version was also released the same year under the title 'Boxing'. It was renamed to 'Punch-Out!!' for it's special 1988 U.S. release.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Here's the system for getting by everyone in one round of Punch Out (Warning: This system works on 9 out of ten Punch Out machines)...

1) Glass Joe: So easy that you'd have to be trying not to win. But to be 100% sure... Keep guard up till his eyes glow for a big punch, dodge, and hammer him with rights and lefts to the face. Repeat till down.

2) Piston Hurricane: Concentrate blows, especially lefts, to the abdomen. When he backs up and charges in, hit him with a blow to the stomach as soon as he charges into you, he'll go down for the count after the 2nd or third time.

3) Bald Bull: Fairly simple: Right, dodge, left left. Right, dodge left left. Look out for his upper cuts though (get out of the way! duh) and upon his bull-charge you have two options. A hit to the stomach when he is right under you puts him down for the count, but if your reflexes aren't optimum, you are better off at dodging and continuing the fight. Right to the face (or 2 lefts), dodge, right. NO BODY BLOWS TO BALD BULL except on the bull charge.

4) Kid Quick: Soooo easy: Right, dodge, right right dodge right right dodge right right dodge right right dodge right right. (these all being blows to the head). VERY EASY as long as you don't lose your rhythm. If ya do get messed up you can usually recover with a a dodge and starting again. No blows to the stomach. This is basically what you'll be doing against Mr. Sandman.

5) Pizza Pasta: Basically you're waiting for him to screw up. Use the kid quick system till he backs off (with the Come on! Come on!) and DODGE his hook. Then pummel him with rights and lefts to the head( ONLY the head), and he won't be fighting back. Repeat till he's dead. If he pins you up against the ropes with shots to the stomach at some point, just get your guard down there and sneak in some lefts and you should break free.

6) Mr. Sandman, the champion: Kid Quick system exactly. Every now and then however he fires a very quick left or right to the head. When he hits you with one, dodge the opposite way of the hit quickly or you'll be going down.

The brave young Pyros armed with only a magic flame as a weapon sets out to rescue his female companion from the clutches of the evil Wardner and bring her safely home. Join him in his adventurous search through the magical forest to save his friend and to break Wardner's spell over the enchanted forest and all the inhabitans.

Q*Bert (c) 10/1982 Gottlieb.

Game ID: GV-103


Q*bert is an energetic little guy, with a big nose, who hops up and down cubicle pyramids in a magical world. When Q*bert hops on a cube, its top changes color, so Q*bert invented a little game: he loves to go from pyramid to pyramid, changing all the cube tops in each pyramid to another color. But nothing comes easily, even in Q'bert's world. Q*bert's enemies, Sam and Coily, do their best to thwart Q*bert in his colorful game. Sometimes they make Q*bert mad enough to say, '!#?'. It takes quick thinking and a quick wrist to help Q*bert change all of the cube tops to the desired color when you succeed, YOU are the Supreme Noser!

Controlled with a 4-way joystick.


- TRIVIA -


Licensed to Konami for Japanese distribution (02/1983).


Inspired by artwork by M.C. Escher who was an artist that Jeff admired. Ron Waxman came up with the idea of Q*Bert changing the color of the cubes. Q*Bert's name originated by the combination of 'Cube' and 'Hubert', but the 'Cube-Bert' was changed to 'Q-Bert' to make it more unique. The concept game was called 'Snots and Boogers' and then '!#?!' (which many of the programmers and Gottlieb VPs said would be impossible to get anyone to say) before the final version was called just 'Q*Bert'. Slick and Sam were a play on the phrase 'spick and span' with Sam being named after co-worker Sam Russo. Rick Tighe came up with the idea of adding the pinball hardware which generated the very mechanical KA-CHUNK when Q*Bert falls off the pyramid.


Approximately 30,000 units were produced by Gottlieb.


A slightly different version known as 'Mello Yello' was programmed for promotion of the Mellow-Yellow softdrink, but it was never released to the market.


A Q*Bert unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Koyaanisqatsi - Life out of Balance'.


Parker Brothers released a boardgame based on this videogame (same name) in 1983: Object of the game is to be one of the 'NOSER ELITE' by collecting more pegs than you opponent. First your Q*bert is moving around the pyramid trying to get as many pegs as you can... Your opponent controls the 'nasty' characters that want to stop you.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hint: A big part of the game is waiting to see where creatures are going to jump. You need to make sure you always time a jump at the same time the creatures jump to you can always have a clear path to a new square.

Qix (c) 10/1981 Taito.

Controlled with a 4-way joystick and two buttons.


- TRIVIA -


The author named the game 'QIX' because his car registration/number plate at the time was: 'JUS4QIX'.


Qix is the first 'drawing game', a truly original game. Also the first totally Taito American game, Qix initially did big numbers, but quickly died when players discovered the machine was 'unbeatable'. Having a googolplex of possible combinations, there was no singular pattern to the game and players lost interest.


Note: pronounced 'KICKS' and not 'QUIX'. :)


A Qix unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks' and in the 1984 movie 'The Karate Kid'.

Quantum (c) 12/1982 Atari.

Game ID: 136016


Controlled with a trackball.


- TRIVIA -


Quantum was the first Atari game to allow a player to try the game without inserting a coin. During the attract mode, the game allowed the player to move the comet to try to capture a particle. During this mode, the messages 'TRY CAPTURING THIS ATOM' and 'MOVE THE TRACKBALL'.


Quantum was also the first game to allow player to 'draw' his name with the trackball when he gets the high score.


Quantum was designed by General Computer for Atari as part of a lawsuit settlement for a "Missile Command" speedup kit to which they affixed their copyright.


Approximately 500 units were produced.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* A Trick: Once you capture a particle (or anything), you should keep circling it. You can keep capturing it over and over until you get tired. For 4x the score, you can apply this trick to two particles at once. Obviously this trick is easier to do on the very early levels.


* Hint: White particles always move vertically, while colored particles always move diagonally. Knowing this may make capturing them easier.

This game runs on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware.


Based on the Neo-Geo fighting game series. The six playable characters are split two each from SNK's three fighting franchises (at the time). They are:

"Art of Fighting": Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia

"Fatal Fury": Terry Bogard and Mai Shiranui

"Samurai Showdown": Haohmaru and Nakoruru


Of these six, Mai is the only one not to appear in the first game of their respective series (Mai debuted in "Fatal Fury 2"). Other characters from these three series appear as the people asking the questions or otherwise standing in the way. The exception is Yuri Sakazaki, of course, as the entire premise of this game is the six of them having to save her.

Rampage - World Tour (c) 03/1997 Midway.


Same as the first one with a big cool lifting and improvement.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and three buttons.


- TRIVIA -


Developed by 'Game Refuge' (see Staff section for more info).


In order to coincide with the 10th anniversary of "Rampage", it was decided to remake the game using the latest Midway Wolf Unit hardware and a mixture of pre rendered graphics and the stop motion animation that proved popular in "Trog". Like "Trog" however, the odd 'issue' presented itself during the programming, delaying the eventual release of the game until after the anniversary had passed. The resulting game did not prove too popular, the original code release contained major bugs and was considered highly repetitive - a modern audience wanted more. Several updated code versions were released to try to make the game more stable and various secrets were 'leaked' to the media, but it could not hide the major gameplay faults. A sequel, "Rampage - Universal Tour" was cancelled as an arcade project.


In some stage you are attacked by ed-209 from "Robocop"!


Stages trivia: There are 130 regular racks/levels in RWT. Each rack is a unique city, and the passage of time is counted in Days (1 day = 1 city). In addition, there are 14 'Transcontinental Flights'; a bonus flying rack in which players chalk up special bonuses. There are are 4 'Grudge Match' racks that pit player against player for an enormous point bonus. The final levels are on the surface of the moon, against hoardes of heavily armed Scumlab astronauts. There are 'hidden' racks as well, in such unlikely places as 'Hades' (complete with Demonic Minions) (...told you Scumlabs had underworld connections), 'Secret Government Area 69' (So thats where all those aliens keep coming from!) and the terrifying, mystical wasteland known only as 'Suburbia', to name a few.

4) Allergic Reactions: Eating certain foods may make you sneeze. Ralph is allergic to cats, Lizzie is allergic to birds, and George is allergic to dogs.

5) Backoff Bellow: Right after another player pops you in the face, pull down on your Joystick and press the Kick Button. You will Bellow at him and leave him dazed.


* A Few Secret Codes: Secret codes must be entered when the name of the appropriate city is displayed. The effect lasts while the Creatures are in that city. A brief message will confirm if the code was entered correctly.

GEORGE (D + J,J,J)

LIZZY (D + P,P,P)

RALPH (D + K,K,K)

When To Use: Each time you return to a US City after taking a World Tour.

GEORGE (J,J)

LIZZY (P,P)

RALPH (K,K)

When To Use: Philadelphia, Carbondale, Santa Fe and Honolulu.


5) Secret Racks: This code sends the players to a rack, or level, that cannot be reached any other way. Note that ALL of the buttons indicated below must be pushed, regardless of the number of players.

GEORGE (J,J,J) AND

LIZZY (P,P,P) AND

Enter the code in chilly Fairbanks to discover the steamy secret of EUSTAS DEMONIC'S UNDERWORLD CONNECTION.

Enter the code in Phoenix to learn whats hidden at secret Government AREA 69.


6) The Ten-City Jump (Rack Advance): This code lets the players jump ahead ten racks or so...making it much easier to reach the exciting finale on the surface of the moon! (...and YES, the rumors are true about what happens in the final moments of the arcade game...) Note that ALL of the buttons indicated below must be pushed, regardless of the number of players.

GEORGE (J,P,K)

Real Bout Fatal Fury 2 - The Newcomers (c) 03/1998 SNK.

Game ID: 0240


Twenty-two of the finest South Town fighters in the seventh installment of this SNK gem.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and four buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game is known in Japan as 'Real Bout Garou Densetsu 2 - The Newcomers' (translates from Japanese as 'Real Bout Hungry Wolf Legend 2 - The Newcomers').


This game runs on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware.


Things that changed in this particular game:

* The game now features 'single plane' stages (like the ones seen in "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters", "Fatal Fury 2" & "Fatal Fury Special") in which you can slam enemies against background objects!

* The breakable objects system seen in Real Bout Special is gone. Also the "evil character" versions of some characters are gone as well.

* Newcomers in this game are: Li Xiangfei, Rick Strowd & Alfred.


A serious bug: Using a USA bios rom if you insert a coin on the 'winners dont use drugs' screen on a single slot the games will use the neogeo bios s1 tileset rather than the game tiles, this causes most of the graphics to be hidden and the games to be unplayable, it will also end up using the mainboard z80 bios so sound will be broken, the games should fix themselves if you let them run another attact loop after gameover, on a multi-slot the games will reset. This is one of the first 4 'gigapower' games, the bug was fixed after that.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Fight Against Alfred: Begin game play in single player mode, finish off the first 10 fights with no Losses, score over 750000 by the time the 10th fight is won, land 5 Super Dead Move's or 7 Dead Move's. You will fight Alfred in a desert type stage.


* You may scope out each character's best records by tapping A button to move forward or B button to move back at the score ranking screen :).

Revolution X (c) 03/1994 Midway.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the Midway X Unit hardware.


The game was originally called 'Generation X', until it was realised Marvel owned the copyright to that name (listen to the opening sequence to hear the game being referred to by it's original title.)


Kerri Hoskins (Helga/Hostage) originally did some footage topless (for secret rooms), with the option of an overlaid bikini as a DIP switch setting. When Midway found out, they forced the programmers to make the bikini addition permanent.


Several subtle in-jokes appear in the game that lead many to believe that the programmers were massive fans of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, although had difficulty recalling it in detail.

1. When the final boss loses limbs, he sometimes says 'Just a flesh wound' a quote from the Black Knight scene.

2. The subtitles in the credits, including 'Why not try a holiday in Norway this yer?' are often slight misquotes of those in the film credits.

3. 'Llamas trained by Nicholas Petro.' Llama jokes a plenty in the TV series and film credits, but moose trainers were included by name in the film. Nicholas is of course the brother of George N. Petro.

4. The dramatic music change and pallete swap of the final credit screen is a nod to the Holy Grail joke where the credit writers were sacked and replaced with another team 'at great expense and at the last minute' who did things in a different way.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* "Trog"!: To see one of the Trogs, you MUST destroy the black cat on the brick wall. After having doing so, you'll notice a palm tree behind the brick wall. Quickly blast the palm tree with a CD. If you are successful, Trog will pop out of the tree and waddle his way across the brick wall. He will gain speed back and forth like the cat. If you shoot him a certain amount of times, you will have access to yet another hidden area in the game.

The reason behind "Trog"'s inclusion? After having such a harrowing time with the Trog project, Petro and Haeger wanted to have an opportunity to blow him away repeatedly in their offices!

* Cool Extra Lives Feature: In your first game, ensure that you get a highscore (the music will change, on the time bonus screen if you've achieved a highscore). Lose all your lives and then 'continue'. You will now show as having 0 toads. Get killed and again, press continue. You now have 99 toads - which comes in well handy on the later conveyor belt levels. Thanks Sega!

- TRIVIA -


Road Blasters was the last of the Atari System 1 hardware games made.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* A Trick: If you crash your car into one of the turrets at the side of the road, you'll get 8-10x the current value of a turret. When your score multiplier is up to 10, this is 16-20,000 points! Early on, keep your score multiplier high and always crash into at least two of these babies every board and finishing the game (or doing very well at it) is not tough. After a while it gets hard to crash into two turrets every board and still finish the board on time.


* Tip For Strategies On Level 49 and 50: Since level 50 is the last level, and the game gives you a complete recharge at the end of 49, accuracy doesn't count any more. Just keep firing as fast as possible.

This game runs on the Atari System 1 hardware.


A graphically enhanced version of this game (Apparently running on "Beat Head" hardware) was planned, where each stage would have a Road Runner cartoon scene as an intermission, spooled from a laserdisc. However, although a master was produced (now in the hands of a private collector of Atari prototypes), no discs were ever pressed and it is likely that no ROMs were ever burned.

This game runs on the "Defender" hardware.


The basic play of Robotron was programmed in three days. The design of Robotron was influenced by "Berzerk" and the Commodore PET game 'Chase'. The original concept name was 'Robot Wars - 1984'.


Robotron shares some sounds from "Defender".


The human characters in this game are named Mommy, Daddy and Mikey. The idea and the inspiration for the character Mikey was from the 1970's commercial for 'Life' cereal.


Williams were sued by Walt Disney Productions for copyright and patent infringement regarding Williams use of 'Tron' in Robotron. Williams won the suit and Walt Disney releases Tron on time.


A Robotron unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Koyaanisqatsi - Life out of Balance'.

* Robotron Name Trick: The formula consists of three sequences of buttons, that all must be completed within a quarter of a second of each other, without the player dying onscreen. The moves are as follows...

1) Fire Up while moving Right and press Player 1 button.

2) Fire Down while moving Up and press Player 2 button.

3) Move Down while firing Up.

The designer's names will appear and stay on the screen until the joystick is released from the Up position. Your game is over(!) once you've done this trick.

Rockman - The Power Battle (c) 09/1995 Capcom.


Have you ever pictured a Mega Man game that allows to skip all the platform elements and just grapple against the bosses? That's pretty much the main idea in this game! Choose from Megaman, Protoman or Bass and battle against classic bosses in the series. Features great 2-D graphics, solid control, and a nice use of strategy (since the right order of weapons will rid you of specific enemies in no time!).

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and three buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game is known outside Japan as "Megaman - The Power Battle".


There are two version, one on the CPS and one on the CPS-II hardware.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Easter Egg: Sometimes when you fight Shade Man, the background music is a version of the theme song from the "Ghosts n' Goblins" series. This seems to happen at random.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* First of all, something that some people don't know is the fact that you can visit the ammo rooms MORE THAN ONCE! The trick is, after having stocked up on your bullets from a particular room (for example, a Machine-Gun-Bullets room), go forward past the door approximately the distance of two jumps, then turn back, visit the room again, and find more ammo. The reason this works is because the game is divided into invisible 'sections'. Once you cross a section boundary, the game forgets everything from the previous section.


* The most impressive glitch in Rolling Thunder, and the one that never ceases to cause people to say: 'What??? How did you DO that???':

1) In levels 5 and 10, once you get to a certain point in the level (around halfway through), you come up against two boxes stacked on top of each other (i.e. you can't jump over it), and a platform above you (on which you jump and continue to the right).

2) At this point, jump up onto the platform, then position yourself at the very right edge of the railing on the platform (you can only jump up/down where railing is present) which should correspond to the very left edge of the boxes, then jump down. This will put you at the very left edge of the boxes.

3) Then, making sure not to move the joystick to the left, walk towards the right, hit the jump button, and watch yourself get sorta caught between the bottom and top boxes, then jump right again, clearing the top box and landing on the ground. Now comes the neat part. Don't fire at anyone, and don't panic, but simply go to the right and watch yourself WALK THROUGH EVERYBODY! Neat, huh?

4) You can simply walk past everyone until you get to the last guy (the guy in the cloak). Then, if you have properly stocked up on MG bullets earlier on this (or another) level, simply hold down the fire button and watch him collapse an inch in front of your face. One last note about using this is that on level 10, in that last area before the final arena, there's the "stairs-like" hurdles, and on each of these steps, one of those annoying white guys will appear.

5) You have to be careful not to be in too much of a hurry, or they will follow you into the arena, where they can and will hurt you, or keep you busy enough that the guy in the cloak will. So make sure you have a little extra time to let those guys disappear off the screen (after you've made all of them appear) before going after the guy in the cloak in the arena.


* This is totally useless, but fun to do anyway: at the end of each level there is this force field, which drags you through the door. Just before you get sucked in, turn your back to the exit and make low jumps (jump button only) while pushing the joystick towards the exit...That results in jumping a bit backwards every time. When the force field catches you, you'll do a cool Michael Jackson'esque exit!

The object of the game is for the player to maneuver his white orobt in 1 of 4 directions within a maze, capture a red character robot as they move about the maze, and race to the center to change the 9 white balls located there to red. The player may only change one white ball to red at a time after he has captured a red robot, and must evade 4 chaser monsters in the process. Bonus point may be earned when capturing the elusive 'red king' that appears on the screen. Capture him and momentarily immobilize the chasers, but do not come in contact with the yellow robots--or your much-needed red robots will be change to white and force you to change strategy. Play is over when the chasr have captured all of the player's robots. But, should the player be successful in changing all of the balls in the center to red, the pattern clears and a different challenge is presented. A 3x3 or 4x4 tri-colored pattern will appear at bottom screen and a slightly different tri-colored cube of corresponding size will appear at center screen. The player may earn bonus points by moving the directional arrow and rearranging the colors of the cube at center screen to match the sample pattern presented at the bottom of the screen. The player is given 90 seconds to rearrange the cube as many times as he can. Action returns to the maze whether you win or lose the cube challenge. All in all, an excting and challenging game where patience and skill are required.

Rygar - Legend Warrior (c) 1986 Tecmo.

Game ID: 6002


You are a barbarian warrior trying to reclaim the land from an evil Dominator and his legions of minions. You fight your way through 27 rounds with a unique weapon which was like a lethal razor sharp disk that he would hurl at enemies!


- TRIVIA -


This game is known in Japan as "Argus no Senshi - Legendary Warrior".


- UPDATES -


The differences between the US (set 1) and US (set 2) are:

* 'Set 2' has a bug in the code which lets p2 start a game when p1 is already playing. You need to set a dipswitch to enable this behaviour (it is usually on by default). If you press '2' while p1 is playing a single player game, 'Set 2' will check that you have 1 or more credit before it registers that you're now in a 2 player game, but it won't deduct the credit. That's a bad bug and probably accounts for why a bugfix version was released.

* In 'Set 2', if p2 starts while p1 is already playing, it says 'playre2' instead of 'player2' at the top right.

* The first screen of 'Set 2' says 'ALL RIGHT RESERVED' - missing an 'S' - that's fixed in 'Set 1'


The differences between the US and Japanese (Argus no Senshi) are:

* The demo sequences are different.

* The Japanese version seems to have more hidden powers, stars and an extra free life.

* The US version is more biased towards stars and explosions.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* 10,000 Points Bonus: At the end of each level, at THE VERY INSTANT the game takes control and guides you into the temple, pull diagonally Leftdown on the joystick. Do it right and you'll get 10,000 points.

Note: The hundred number of your points must be the same as the units of your time, for example, 33,330 points and 13.30 seconds, or 100.000 points and 00.00 seconds.


* If the 'invincibility' bonus is gotten when having the 4 other bonuses, you get normal invincibility (30 seconds) PLUS 170,000 points.

Samurai Shodown takes most of its characters from either historical sources or characters from the Ninja Scroll anime. In fact, a few designers that worked on Samurai Shodown also worked on the Ninja Scroll anime.


Haohmaru is based on the legendary samurai Miyamoto Musashi (1584-1645), whose fighting philosophy heavily influenced that of the Haohmaru character.


Ukyo Tachibana is Based on Sasaki Kojiro Genryu (1572-1612), Musashi's skilled rival.


Jubei Yagyu is based on the historical Yagyu Jubei Mitsuyoshi (1606-1644), who was a sword instructor to the Tokugawa shogunate. The Yagyu clan was a famous clan of samurai.


Hattori Hanzo Masashige (1541-1596) was the most famous of the Iga Ninja clan. He was a genius at leading night raids on forts and fiefs and became a feared assassin. Under his leadership, Iga Ninja became so notorious that Nobunaga felt it necessary to obliterate the Iga Ninja clan.


Wan-Fu seems to be a combination of two famous Chinese warriors. The first is a famous Chinese swordsman who was a rebel during the Ch'ing Dynasty. His name was Wang Ts-bin Wu, but he became known as Da Dao Wang Wu ('Big Scimitar Wang Wu'). The second lead bases Wan Fu upon the ancient, almost legendary, founder of the Chou Dynasty, King Wu Wang.


Kyoshiro Senryo is based on Nemuri Kyoshiro, a fictional character created by Shibata Tosaburo. 'Kyoshiro' translates to something like 'deranged fellow'. Tosaburo's Kyoshiro had nothing to do with kabuki theatre as does Samurai Shodown Kyoshiro. Kyoshiro's weapon is called a naginata.


Charlotte is based on a character in the manga 'The Rose of Versailles' by Riyoko Ikeda (1972).


Gen-an Shiranui looks much like Mushizo, the hunchback demon of Ninja Scroll. Gen-an's weapon is modeled after the weapon wielded by Shijima, the shadow demon, from Ninja Scroll. Although they share a surname, Gen-an is not a relative of Mai Shiranui of the Fatal Fury/King of Fighters series.


Amakusa Shiro Tokisada (1622-1638) led a Christian uprising against the Tokugawa shogunate in the Shimabara region of Japan.


Nakoruru is a homage to Sailor Moon.


A 'Kuroko' is a traditional Kabuki theatre stagehand. They are traditionally dressed in black and took care of scenery and other behind-the-scenes needs during a Kabuki performance, just like modern theatre stagehands. In the case of Samurai Shodown, Kuroko is the referee for each match in Samurai Shodown I and II. The black strip of fabric hanging over a Kuroko's face is to signify that they are not part of the Kabuki performance, just helping with the props. The red and white flags that Kuroko has are used in traditional martial arts matches, where each successful hit gets the corresponding fighter's flag raised.


Mai Shiranui (of Fatal Fury) appears in Haohmaru's and Gen-An's endings.


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Samurai Spirits - PCCB-00135) on 17/09/1993.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Alternate Costume Colors: Highlight a fighter at the character selection screen and press D.


* Sleeping Mamahaha: This is just hilarious! To see this while playing as Nakoruru simply stand still, after a 8 secs or so Mamahaha will land on Nakoruru's shoulder, start yawning and then it will fall asleep! :)


* Poppy's Puppies: To see a truly cool & funny secret pose with Galford, Get a PERFECT against an oponnent while unarmed. You must finish the battle with anything except a throw though!


* Tam Tam's Broken Ending: If you use continues while beating the game with Tam Tam, you will miss a part of the whole ending (You can't see his real face). Beat the game with one credit in order to see his face.


* Wan-fu's Sword Explosion Bug: While playing as Wan-fu trap an enemy against the edge of the screen then perform the Explosive Sword Drop with the B button (HCB + B) to throw the sword and land next to the oponnent. Since most players as well as the CPU are likely to block the move, crouch and hit them with the C button (a short kick). This will make the move unblockable and causes tons of damage!!!


* Cut-proof Characters?: Sometimes a finishing slash will cut most oponnents in half, however some characters (these being Kyoshiro & Amakusa) cannot be cut in half!

Samurai Shodown II (c) 10/1994 SNK.

Game ID: 0063


The second game in this wildly popular series features fifteen weapon-wielding fighters clashing to earn the right to face the extremely difficult end boss.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and four buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game is known in Japan as "Shin Samurai Spirits - Haohmaru Jigokuhen" (translates from Japanese as 'True Samurai Spirits - Haohmaru's Incident In Hell').


This game runs on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware.


Kafuin Nicotine (Anglicized as 'Caffiene') is based somewhat on the Ninja Scroll character Dakuan who shares outfit and is armed with similar weapons. The 'papers' that Nicotine throws are called 'o-fuda', which are talismans inscribed with a prayer to endow them with certain powers. Japanese occultism and lore at work.


Neinhalt Sieger's name translates from German as 'non-stop victory'.


Genjuro Kibagami is a huge reference to a Japanese hanafuda deck. Hanafuda is a Japanese card game in which all cards represent a certain flower and time of the year. The hanafuda cards can be seen when Genjuro hits his opponent with special moves. Among the cards seen are wistaria, maple and peony. All cards shown are from an actual hanafuda deck.


Ryuhaku Todo (of AOF) appears in Gen-An's ending.


If you wait a long time, Hikyaku will throw food and/or bombs to the screen. Every so often, Kim Kaphwan (of Fatal Fury) will come out instead.


Kuroko's moves are largely borrowed from other characters.


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack records for this game (Shin Samurai Spirits - PCCB-00164) on 02/11/1994.

Samurai Shodown III (c) 10/1995 SNK.

Game ID: 0087


Continuing the aesthetic tradition and high quality of the very successful series and featuring twelve selectable characters and an extremely pissed end boss.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and four buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game is known in Japan as "Samurai Spirits - Zankurou Musouken" (literally: Samurai Spirits - Zankuro's Matchless Sword).


This game runs on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware.


Kafuin Gaira is a Buddhist monk whose weapons are giant 'mala', or Buddhist prayer beads. When Gaira wins the first round of a match, he throws a few punches and says 'Tenchu!', which means 'retribution!'. Gaira says a traditional Buddhist prayer for his fallen opponent when he wins the final round of the match. 'Namu amida butsu', Gaira's prayer, is basically 'go to heaven' or 'rest in peace'.


Shizumaru Hisame is a homage to Himura Kenshin (a character from the manga 'Rurouni Kenshin').


Zankuro Minazuki is a homage to Raijyuta Isurugi (another character from 'Rurouni Kenshin').


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Play As Zankuro: It is possible to play as Zankuro in Samurai Showdown 3. The catch is that you can ONLY use it for 2P mode (ie. against a human opponent). Here's how you do it. With the cursor on Haohmaru, go straight to the following characters in order: Basara, Kyoshiro, Nakoruru, Haohmaru, Shizumaru, Rimururu, Amakusa, Gaira and Shizumaru. Wait until the timer says '03' on it and then press Start+A+B+C.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and four buttons.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* I'm Not Afraid Of You!: Think you are really good? Tap Start 3 times quickly to make your character drop his/her sword. Now show your opponents that the most fearsome weapons are the ones you were born with! :). Note: A few characters are really hampered by the loss of weapon (eg. Haohmaru, Kazuki, Sogetsu) and a few are not really affected (Nakoruru, Rimururu, Hanzo).


* Sepukku (Suicide): Press Back, then move your joystick a quarter circle from forwards to down and press Start to make your character kill himself/herself and lose the current round (Useless trick? Not quite since you will start the next round with a full rage gauge!).


* Silly Name Trick: Now this is weird! At the naming screen input 'AAA' as your name to make your character faint!

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


*  If you manage to shoot all the first few screens worth of enemies (which is much easier with two players) you get rewarded with a group of dragonflies moving across the top. Each dragonfly is worth 10,000 points.


* Watch out for WOPs, which are POWs in reverse. They reduce your power level.


* There are special POWs that turn enemies into fruit. They're not the pretty POW on a circular background - those give power-ups - these are just the word POW. If you find one of these, hold off on using it until you get several of the bigger enemies onscreen. They're worth 5,000 points in their fruit form.

Ten fighters, each brandishing a weapon, fight to have a crack at the Real King Lion. There are two planes of action to switch from and in some cases the player can use elements of the background as weapons.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and four buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game is known in Japan as "Fu'un Mokushiroku - Kakutou Sousei" (translates from Japanese as 'Wind and Cloud Apocalypse - Hand-to-Hand Fighting Genesis'). 'Mokushiroku' is Japanese for the Christian book of Revelation, also known as the Apocalypse. 'Sousei' is Japanese for 'creation of the world', or 'genesis'. 'Sousei' and 'Mokushiroku' are diametrically opposed, just like 'Genesis' and 'Apocalypse' - and used here as a metaphor for the conflict between Syo Hayate and Shishi-Oh (King Lion).


This game runs on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware.


'Fu'un' in the Savage Reign series actually refers to the fighting style of the main character, Syo Hayate.


- UPDATES -


In the Japanese version :

* King Lion is named Kage Shishioh.

* King Leo is named Shin Shishioh.

Japanese children play a version of paper-rock-scissors called 'jan ken pon'. 'jan, ken, pon' is chanted and the hands are thrown as tradition dictates. If there is a tie, a second round begins to the chant of 'aiko denshou' and the hands are thrown again. Traditionally, the loser of jan ken pon gets hit on the head with a fan, but in the case of Scud Hammer the fan has been replaced by a hammer and the object is to knock your opponent out with it.

Sea Wolf II (c) 06/1978 Midway.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the Bally Midway Astrocade hardware.


Sea Wolf II is the first-ever sequel! It was basically the exact same game as its predecessor with a few cosmetic improvements.


Still, at least one of the cosmetic tweaks in "Sea Wolf"'s case was a ground-breaker in its own right - though there's some argument over the fact, Sea Wolf II is generally thought to have been the first coin-op to use genuine colour (i.e. not just sticking some bits of red and yellow cellophane over a black-and-white screen). Colour was the breakthrough that started to lure people other than pasty computer geeks into arcades to see what all the fuss was about (and ruin it for all the pasty computer geeks at the same time), and as such Sea Wolf II probably represents the very first 'modern' video game.

Released two years after the original, this Mega Play version can be considered as a reduced version:

* Stages: Green hill -> Spring year -> Starlight -> Scrap brain (1,2) -> Final zone.

* You have a limited amount of time per level (usually pretty tight, 1 minute is the easy setting for the first level, 35 seconds seems to be the hardest).

* Extra life boxes do nothing.

* Jumping into the special stage ring does nothing (no special stages).

* When you finish it sonic seems to have the 'you didn't get any emeralds' look despite there being no emeralds due to the lack of special stages.

Last Battle - Legend of the Final Hero (c) 1989 Sega.

Game ID: Mega-Tech No. 20


- TRIVIA -


This game is known in Japan as "Shin Seikimatsu Kyuuseishu Densetsu - Hokuto no Ken" (translates from Japanese as 'New End of the Century Savior Legend - Fist of the Big Dipper').


This game is based on the manga 'Hokuto no Ken' by Buronson and Tetsuo Hara. 'Hokuto' is the Japanese word for the constellation known in the west as 'The Big Dipper'. This is why the main character, Kenshirou, has seven scars in the shape of the big dipper on his chest, not just one scar representing the north star.


- UPDATES -


Changes from Japanese version:

* Blood removed, Enemies now just fly off screen instead of exploding.

* All characters are recolored.

* Characters were all given stupid names. Kenshirou became Aarzak, Bat became Max, Lin became Alyssa, etc.

* Chapter titles removed.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Continue: When you lose your last life and the word 'Legend of the Final Hero' appear, hold A+B+C and then press Start to continue on the stage that you died on.

The bonus stage scene was greatly inspired by Taito's "Cameltry".

Restart: Pause gameplay and press A.

Frame advance: Pause gameplay and press C.

Bandai released a boardgame based on this video game (Commando): A simple roll-and-move type game, with symbols on the board indiciating what happens when you land on that spot. There are multiple choices on which direction to go, but not too much in the way of required thinking. There are many different boards that you progress through, each 'board' representing one 'stage' of the game.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Here's A Hot Way To Kill The Soldiers Without Going Anywhere Near Them: At the end of each area, when the enemy soldiers are pouring out of the gate from their compound, move your commando to the bottom of the screen and shoot down. Your shots will come down from the top of the screen, killing the soldiers as they come out of the gate.


* This will let you rack up big points and all the extra men you can: On the first stage there is a cliff on the right side of the screen. The bad guys will jump off the end of this cliff and attack you. If you walk until the bad guys START jumping off and then stop you can stand there and kill them until you get sick of playing or until you reach the max extra men.

If you plan on playing thru the rest of the game you should stop at the max amount of extra men. If you just sit there the enemies will get faster and faster so the rest of the game will be harder.

* At the end of stage 1, a large plane rises in front of the player. If you stand .25 to .5 inches up from the bottom of the cliff, and line up so your bullets will hit just to the right of the plane's center, it cannot hit you with its cannon. This takes practice.

- TRIVIA -


The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Freshman Tooru-kun'.


This game is known outside Japan as "Mikie".


The classroom level of Mikie plays the song 'A Hard Day's Night' by The Beatles. The Gym Level plays 'Twist and Shout', the Medley/Russell song made famous by the Fab Four.


- UPDATES -


* Shinnyuushain Tooru-Kun: This is the original version. Mikie has red hair (because we all know that redheads are temperamental troublemakers :)). Football players are now Bulky Students (Classroom) or Police/Probation Officers (Garden). All of the students wear uniforms, including Mikie. Your classroom teacher wears a white shirt and is somewhat pudgier than his American counterpart. Many of the rooms also have a slightly different appearance and I believe the dance studio teacher wears glasses. Go figure.


* Mikie (High School Graffitti): Aside from the noticeably different decor in the homeroom (all right, it's only the blackboard), there are several MAJOR differences in this MUCH harder version. Hearts that were normally in glass cases are stacked as piles of three hearts (you only have to time the last heart for Perfects). Furthermore, you can't headbutt in this version, you have to yell, which temporarily stuns enemies EXCEPT FOR your homeroom teacher, who cannot be stopped except by thrown items. Yelling is also much shorter range than headbutting, making timing crucial. Not a version for the weak-reflexed. Most importantly though is that if you take too long in a room, the Classroom teacher can throw what looks like either a necklace or dentures at you. On the plus side, you recover faster from a yell than a headbutt (less lag time) and enemies don't speed up as fast as they do in the other romsets (unfortunately, it seems as though the homeroom teacher will speed up on his own in this romset).

Then Homer says 'Now for some calming blue', and reaches for Bart. Seeing that Bart is wearing an orange shirt, he says 'Where's your blue shirt?'. Bart replies 'I don't have a blue shirt'.


* In some parts of the game, the bow in Maggie's hair is pink. Other times, it is the correct blue color.


* The rabbit characters that appear in various places in the game are from Matt Groening's comic strip, 'Life in Hell'.


* Smithers is much more evil in this game than he has ever been in the show. In the series, Smithers is (as Burns himself put it) 'the sober Yin to [Burns'] raging Yang'. In this game he is depicted as a cape-wearing, bomb-throwing psycho. Smithers' voice is wrong - Smithers is colored wrong. The color scheme used in this game appears to be based on the episode 'Homer's Oddysey', in which Smithers was colored incorrectly. In this episode, his skin color was also incorrect: instead being yellow, it was a dark pink color. Also, Smithers has never worn a cape, as he does in this game (Perhaps he has an evil twin who is a cape-wearing mad bomber!).


* Mr. Burns' voice also sounds wrong, except when he says 'Excellent'. The 'Excellent' voice sample was taken directly from the show and the rest of the lines were recorded by a different actor.


* SPOILER ALERT!: After Mr. Burns has been defeated, his eyes turn into Xs as he is lying on the ground. In the series Bart's eyes were drawn as Xs in a dream sequence, when Bart was imagining that school bully Nelson Muntz had beaten him to death and the school nurse had reconstructed his face for his funeral.


* In this game Sideshow Bob helps you by giving you food that restores your health. Since a first season episode where he framed Krusty the Klown for armed robbery and his plans were foiled by the Simpson kids, he is normally a villain. It seems that this game was made before the first season was finished (Or at least the people who worked on the game hadn't seen all of the episodes yet).


* The 'Moe's Tavern' stage in this game does not look much like it's TV counterpart. In this game it seems to be underground and only accessible by hidden elevators (One of the elevators is in a fake 'Krusty' grave in the cemetary stage, the other in a wall of rock in the 'Springfield Butte' stage). Of course, in the series it is just a regular building with a regular door that people walk through off the street.


* In this game, Barney's hair color is the same color as his skin (yellow). He appeared this way in a few early episodes of the fisrt season, but later his hair was colored brown and only the Simpson kids have hair that is the same color as their skin.


* Channel 6 (Stage 7): The anchorman in this stage is the same one that appears in the episode 'Call of the Simpsons'. In that episode, this anchorman sounds just like Kent Brockman, but looks completely different. The anchorman's hair was colored gray in the episode, but in this game the anchorman is colored like Scott Christian (Early on in the series, an anchor named Scott Christian would frequently be 'filling in for Kent Brockman', the regular anchorman. Eventually Christian was dropped from the series and they just used Kent Brockman). This anchorman is neither Kent Brockman or Scott Christian. If you stand in front of the anchorman, he will get mad. If you jump up on the anchor's desk, he will shrug his shoulders.


- UPDATES -


* In the Japanese version, there are nuclear bombs laying around that can be thrown at enemies (for example, in front of the Noiseland Arcade in the first level). These bombs are not present in the other versions. These bombs look the same as the ones Mr. Burns shoots at you on the last level.


* In the Japanese version, you can fill you life meter past full. For example, if your life meter is already full and you get an item that restores your health, you get no benefit in the non-Japanese versions. But in the Japanese version, you will get additional health points, indicated in the meter by a different color (When the life meter is full, it is purple. When it goes past full, the additional health is shown in yellow).

Sinistar (c) 02/1983 Williams.


Controlled with an 8-way joystick and two buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the "Defender" hardware but has an additional Harris 55564-5 CVSD.


This game was originally going to be called 'Juggernaut', then 'Darkstar'. The prototype version called 'Sinistar' is a machine that was displayed at the 11/1982 AMOA show in Las Vegas. The revision 2 was the most common version of the game.


A Sinistar unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames'.


- UPDATES -


PROTOTYPE (AMOA):

* The Sinistar logo in the attract mode uses a Rocky-Horror-esque 'dripping blood' font.

* The letter 'T' shows up behind the 'dripping blood' logo, possibly part of the trademark?.

* The Sinistar death sequence sometimes occurs offscreen.

* There seem to be more crystals per planetoid than in the release revision.

* Missing the 'set attract mode message' option in the game adjustments screen.

* High score entry uses fire to advance to the next character, rather than the joystick.

* Warping to the next level can occur in any direction, not just upper-right.

* Sinistar's 'roar' occurs multiple times in rapid succession, cutting off each time he is hit by a sinibomb.

* When a player's ship is destroyed by the Sinistar, it explodes rather than spinning out first.

* After defeating Sinistar, his face outline doesn't appear in the center of the screen.

* You can set the extra ship points AND extra ship point factors to ZERO. As soon as you get a point, the game program gets caught in an infinite loop. You'll also hear an EXTENDED extra ship noise. You can break the loop by hitting advance and looking at ALL the extra ships you just received.

* Stuff (like the Sini-bombs, warriors and even the Sinistar himself (if it has a gender)) doesn't travel well from scanner to playfield and these objects can make quick second passes and sometimes even just skip the playfield all together.

* Survivors Today Has the following initials when tables are cleared: YYY XYS MAA AAA AAA AAA BDG MAA AAA AAA ABC EJS MAA AAA AAA RED HPG MAA AAA AAB CFL XYS MAA AAA AAB DGN DBG MAA AAA BCE.

* Scores start at 19045 and are listed with the following algorithm (-265, -365, -265, repeat).


REVISION 2:

* The Survivors Today has the following initials: N-F KJF KAG FRG YAK JJK KFL PJM DOC JLM E-Z =M= TIM JRN TOM PFZ RTP BFD MBS MRS EJS STU WIT MOM FAC GOD KAY HEC SAM KYD (Note: They keep the same order, but rotate position every time the machine is reset).

* Added 'Set Attract mode message' option in the game adjustments menu.


REVISION 3:

* Latest revision.

* Some bugs fixed.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Programming Credits And Williams message:

1) Set lives to 1 (This is optional, it merely saves time).

2) Insert one credit.

3) Bump into a Planetoid (rock).

4) Push the fire button seven times.

5) Avoid Planetoids and Workers, don't fire at anything and get shot by a Warrior. If you set lives to 1, the game will now be over. If not, lose all lives in this manner until the game ends.

6) Enter initials.

7) Press the 2 Player button 3 times, then insert one coin and start a new 1 Player game.

8) Don't move or fire, just push the Sinibomb button once.


There are now two messages which can be displayed for the credits:

9) Insert 3 coins, then push the Sinibomb button again. The 'crossword' credits should now be displayed.


* For the Williams Electronics message:

10) Simply end the game by getting shot without hitting a Planetoid or firing, then push the 1 Player button to display the message.


* 255 Lives Trick: This little trick is harder than the game itself, but worth it if you pull it off. On your last man, make sure a warrior fires at you just as Sinistar sucks you in. As the Sinistar sucks you in, you will lose your last man, but when the warrior's bullet hits you, you will have one less than zero ships.

Note: The warriors stop shooting as soon as you are 'caught' by Sinistar. The game was programmed this way, to prevent you from dying twice. Since you are trying to die twice, you have to let a warrior shoot at you, before you get sucked in, then hope that the shot hits you after you have been sucked in. This is very tricky.

Note 2: 8-bit processors can only handle values from 0-255, for a total of 256 values. Therefore, 'one less than zero ships' will roll around to 255.

This is quite a fun game, where you score points for landing on an ever decreasing patch of 'good' land. Why 'good'? As you descend without opening your parachute your landing point becomes smaller, but the points become higher, just don't leave pulling the ripcord too late because the Newtonian laws concerning gravity is working against you. Each time you successfully land the plane goes lower.


- TRIVIA -


The designer of this game was a pinball fan, so this is the first video game to have a pinball feature. The lamps behind the marquee for SKYDIVER are software controllable. When you start the game, the letters flash one at a time. When you jump, the lamps stop on whatever letter is on, and if you land successfully, you 'earn' that letter below your score. Spell out Skydiver, and, depending on the options settings, you could earn a free life, a free game, or bonus points.

Snow Bros. - Nick & Tom (c) 04/1990 Toaplan.

Game ID: MIN16-02


A Toaplan platformer in the tradition of "Bubble Bobble". You either control Nick or Tom, you must navigate over 50 levels of snowball making, to finish. Featuring some nice anime-ish looking creature that turn into Japanese delectable delights when killed with a snowball.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and two buttons.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* 10,000 Points: Finish the level by killing all the enemies with one snowball or two snowballs, but you need to use only one push. Meaning put two snowballs alongside each other and push only one snowball, the snowball will 'ricochet' of the other one and it will still count as one snowball. If done correctly 'mahjong' tiles worth 10,000 point will fall from the sky. Works best if you have the red speed-up bonus, with it you could easily get up to 1 million points before you reach the first boss.


* Hidden Functions: If the 'Invulnerability dip switch' is enabled, you are invulnerable but you may also 'Pause' the game with P2 Start and restart with P1 Start.

Son Son is Capcom's tribute to a Chinese legend called 'Xiyou Ji', meaning 'Journey to the West', considered to be one of the four classic pieces of Chinese literature (and a fairly good read). The main character in Xiyou Ji is Sun Wukong, or, when you pronounce the words as if they were Japanese kanji, Son Gokuu (hence the name Son Son).


This game features one of the first game soundtracks composed by Tamayo Kawamoto, who made also other Capcom 80's BGM. She now works at Taito: she's a member of Zuntata, the popular (well, in Japan) Taito band where she plays keyboards.

* Consoles:

Nintendo Super Famicom (1992): The SFC version is the arcade game with a side scrolling beat-em-up game added to it, which (understandably) became the primary part of the game. The arcade game in its entirety appears as a bonus game between levels and you only get one chance to pick your target and attempt to KO it, just as if you were playing the arcade game with one credit, except you go on to the next side-scrolling beat-em-up level in the SFC game instead of the 'GAME OVER' screen in the arcade game.

How the SFC version plays: Instead of an actual target that you have to punch with your own actual fist as in the arcade version, you get an on-screen power gauge in the SFC version. Like the arcade version, you are given given three rounds to do enough cumulative damage to KO the target. The power gauge is empty at the start of each round. To build up the power gauge, rapidly press LEFT and RIGHT alternately and repeatedly on the directional pad of the SFC controller. The gauge will deplete RAPIDLY the moment you stop pressing LEFT and RIGHT so do not stop! You are given a time limit for building up the power gauge each round. When you have built up sufficient power, press any button to punch. If you have exceeded the time limit, you will automatically punch at whatever power level the gauge is at. The damage you inflict on the target is proportional to the power level of the gague at the time of the punch.

This game is a bootleg of "Space Invaders".


Video Games GMBH (located in the town of Lich in Germany) started as an unauthorized bootleg manufacturer (i.e.: Space Attack). When the European countries changed their laws to protect the original creators, they started to develop their own arcade games. However, only two original games from Video Games GMBH are known to exist: "Super Tank" (1981) and "Looping" (1982).

The World Hottest Game! The player must strategically position, then fire his laser missile launcher attempting to knock out the ever-attacking invaders before they can drop missiles destroying the defender's protective bunkers and missile launcher.

Controlled with a 2-way joystick and one button.


- TRIVIA -


Licensed by Midway for US production (Game ID: 739).


Some bootlegs of this game are known as "Super Invaders", "Super Earth Invasion", "Alien Invasion Part II" and "Space War Part Three".

Some clones were manufactured by other manufacturers, they are known as "IPM Invader", "Cosmic Monsters", "Space Attack", "Space Attack II", "Jatre Specter", "Space War" and "Space King".


The game that started the whole damn craze!! Space Invaders caused a yen shortage in Japan. Many regular produce and goods stores in Japan removed their products and converted into SI parlors overnight, complete with giant speakers broadcasting the 'thump-thump-thump' of the marching invaders. A classic in every sense of the word.


SI contains the first attract mode with a sense of humour, it would display 'INSERT CCOIN' and an invader would come along and bomb the offending 'C'.


Note: There are exactly 60 invaders per screen and exactly 11 different sounds.


Space Invaders was the first arcade game to work its way out of seedy arcades and into pizza parlors and ice cream shops. The Space Invaders phenomenon stuns conservative adults who are certain the games sour the minds of their youngsters. Residents of Mesquite, Texas push the issue all the way to the Supreme Court in their efforts to ban the illicit machines from their Bible-belt community.


Space Invaders inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Space Invaders' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album.


A Space Invaders unit appears in the 1980 movie 'Midnight Madness', in the 1982 movie 'Jekyll & Hyde... Together Again', in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks' and in the 1991 movie 'Terminator 2 - Judgment Day'.


- UPDATES -


A company called Logitec manufactured a bootleg of Space Invaders with a colour monitor. While most of the screen remains B&W, the green is actually generated by the PCB (Printed Circuit Board) and although it looks very much like an overlay it's not. Back then this pirated PCB, because of it's design and minimal memory room on the PCB, (remember we are talking old technology), the game was very complex for it's time. It used an old 8080 processor which unlike the Z80 processor, it had its limitations. When this game was first designed it was originally going to be released as a B&W game and not colour. The green is done by taking a segement out of the video proccesing area of the PCB and pulling it down with a bipolar prom to generate the affect. There are actually 2 video lines on this pcb - 1 for B&W and the other for sync and colour.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hidden Message: To see it, wait until the demo starts and then press at the same time the keys Left, Right, Fire, 1 player start and 2 player start. Press them repeatedly as fast as you can. After a few seconds, the message ('TAITO COP') will appear below the high score.


* To achieve higher scores, count the number of shots fired from your base. Begin counting shots as soon as each level begins. Fire 22 shots and then wait for the UFO to cross the screen. Use shot number 23 to hit the UFO and you will receive 300 points. After hitting the UFO, start counting your shots again. This time, count to 14 and use the 15th shot to hit the UFO. Once again you will receive 300 points. Repeat counting using the 14 shot method until the screen is cleared of enemies. When the next level starts, repeat the procedure using 22 shots, 14 shots, 14 shots, etc...

Space Invaders Deluxe (c) 11/1979 Midway.

Game ID: 852


The world's hottest game... now even more challenging! New colorful screen patterns, increased invader fire power, high scorer's name registered on screen, etc...


- TRIVIA -


This game is also known as "Space Invaders Part II" (Taito).

Space Invaders Deluxe still says "Space Invaders Part II" on the titlescreen because Midway was only allowed to make minor modifications of the Taito code. All other references to the game (promotional material, manual, service bulletins, labels on the motherboard, serial number tags inside the cabinet, monitor glass, etc.) say 'Space Invaders Deluxe'.


This game was also manufactured by Nichibutsu under the name of "Moon Base".


A Space Invaders Deluxe unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High'.


- UPDATES -


Difference beetween the Taito version (SI part II):

* Changes in gameplay include invaders that march forward, invaders that split to form two when shot, another bonus ship that flies by above the invaders, intermissions between racks and the famous 'rainbow bonus'.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hidden Message: During the gameplay demo portion of attract mode press the following buttons at the same time: Right+Fire+2P Start. Then press the following buttons at the same time: Left+Fire+1P Start. The message ('TAITO CORP.') will appear below the high score. The 'spelling error' on Space Invaders is corrected.


* Extra Life: The machine will award you a bonus life during the intermission if you were able to wipe out the previous screen in 55 shots or less. Of course, this is very difficult to do. However, you can take advantage of the famous 8-bit rollover bug by firing OVER 255 shots, thereby rolling over the shot counter! Just make sure you can wipe out the remaining invaders in under 55 shots after you roll the counter over..


* Rainbow Trick: Leave one of the bottom-most aliens to kill last. Youll receive 500 points and a 'rainbow' display. If you left the bottom left-most alien, youll receive 1,000 points.


* Preset Mode: Space Invaders Deluxe provided a way the operator could enter his/her name each time the machine was turned on.

1) Turn preset mode ON in the DIP switch.

2) Insert one credit.

3) Depress one player select button 'Preset Mode' will be displayed on screen.

4) Depress one player select button again to increase score until previous high-score is beaten. Note: If you press the two player select button you can skip the starting level as well.

5) Depress fire button to start game. After all bases have been destroyed the alphabet will be displayed on screen. A new name may now be entered.

6) Turn preset mode OFF in the DIP switch to re-establish game mode.

Space Invaders II (c) 03/1980 Midway.

Game ID: 851


Space Invaders II allowed for two player simultaneous competitive play (although both players could work together). Besides shooting the invaders, one of the goals was to destroy your opponent (either CPU or another player) and gain his ships!


- TRIVIA -


This game was a Midway in-house project, done by Joel Kreger. His name can be found in one of the game ROMs using a hex editor. This game runs on modified SI Deluxe hardware, with two sound boards; one for each player. Player 2's sound was a bit higher in pitch than player 1. The overlay contained many colors, running from red (player 1) to yellow (player 2), with various shades of blue and green in between.

Space Invaders Part II (c) 09/1979 Taito.


- TRIVIA -


Also licensed to Midway under the name of "Space Invaders Deluxe".


This game was also manufactured by Nichibutsu as "Moon Base".


- UPDATES -


Midway licensed a different version for US consumption (SI Deluxe):

* Changes in gameplay include invaders that march forward, invaders that split to form two when shot, another bonus ship that flies by above the invaders, intermissions between racks and the famous 'rainbow bonus'.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hidden Message: During the gameplay demo portion of attract mode press the following buttons at the same time: Right+Fire+2P Start. Then press the following buttons at the same time: Left+Fire+1P Start. The message ('TAITO CORP.') will appear below the high score. The 'spelling error' on Space Invaders is corrected.


* Extra Life: The machine will award you a bonus life during the intermission if you were able to wipe out the previous screen in 55 shots or less. Of course, this is very difficult to do. However, you can take advantage of the famous 8-bit rollover bug by firing OVER 255 shots, thereby rolling over the shot counter! Just make sure you can wipe out the remaining invaders in under 55 shots after you roll the counter over..


* Rainbow Trick: Leave one of the bottom-most aliens to kill last. Youll receive 500 points and a 'rainbow' display. If you left the bottom left-most alien, youll receive 1,000 points.


* Preset Mode: Space Invaders Part II provided a way the operator could enter his/her name each time the machine was turned on.

1) Turn preset mode ON in the DIP switch.

2) Insert one credit.

3) Depress one player select button 'Preset Mode' will be displayed on screen.

4) Depress one player select button again to increase score until previous high-score is beaten. Note: If you press the two player select button you can skip the starting level as well.

5) Depress Fire button to start game. After all bases have been destroyed the alphabet will be displayed on screen. A new name may now be entered.

6) Turn preset mode OFF in the DIP switch to re-establish game mode.

Space Wars (c) 10/1977 Cinematronics.


- TRIVIA -


Space Wars was the first vector game.


The game was originally brought to Midway, but Rosenthal balked at their ridiculous royalty offer. He sold the game and hardware to Cinematronics and signed a contract for 50% of the royalties; unheard of in those days. Rosenthal later left Cinematronics, taking all technical documents with him and leaving poor Tim Skelly to scrounge for information. Luckily, he found a tech who had helped Rosenthal when he was pressed for time and obtained the opcodes and technical info needed. Cinematronics sued Rosenthal, but they settled, with Larry's company, Vectorbeam, being bought by Cinematronics. Looks like ol' Larry made out like a bandit!!


A Space Wars unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Tron'.

Spartan X (c) 1984 Irem.


- TRIVIA -


This game is known outside Japan as "Kung-Fu Master".


This game runs on the Irem M-62 system hardware.


First scrolling beat-em-up, this game is based on the movie 'Wheels on Meals', starring Jackie Chan (as Thomas) and Sammo Hung (who also directed). This movie is called 'Spartan X' in Japan.


- UPDATES -


Differences between Spartan X and Kung-Fu Master:

* During the demo screen the word Kung-Fu (in 'A KUNG-FU MASTER, THOMAS....') is spelled 'KANFU' in Spartan X.

* Spartan X has an additional copyright notice that is not in Kung-Fu Master: '(C)1984 Paragon Films Ltd., Towa Promotion'.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Slow Motion Mode: Turn 'slow motion mode' ON in dipswitch. In game, press Start 2 to slow game speed.


* Stop Mode: Turn 'Freeze' ON in dipswitch. In game, press Start 2 to stop and Start 1 to restart.


* Level Seclection Mode: Turn 'Level seclection mode' ON in dipswitch. In game, press Start 1 to select and Start 2 to restart.


* Hint: Time your punches properly. They give you double score compared with the kicks, but they're much more risky, as you can fall short with your punch and get grabbed.


* Defeating the Bosses:

1) FIRST BOSS: Easy. Wait to his first pole swing from a safe distance and then quickly get close (stuck) to him. From now on, his attacks won't hit you. Walk forward (making him walk back) until you reach the staircases and then start punching him in the belly.

2) SECOND BOSS: First, clean your back of henchmen. Then, wait for the boomerang dude to throw his first boomerang , avoid it and this is the time! You have to hit him like hell while he's waiting to recover his boomerang. Punches hurt double. If you're quick enough punching, he won't recover his first boomerang.

3) THIRD BOSS: Just make a jumping moving kick, hit him in the chest, and as soon you touch the floor (falling down from the jumping kick) start punching fast as hell! With any luck he won't touch you anyway. Be sure to have spare energy to perform this movement just in case he has time to give you a kick (1/4 of the bar would be enough).

4) FOURTH BOSS: Watch out, this one is tricky. First, take him to the limits where he can walk (He suddenly stops as he can't get closer to you). Then come closer to him and duck, avoiding his projectiles. Then, a copy of him will appear at your back. Stand up and start walking (avoiding projectiles again) just as you did with the first boss. As soon as you arrive at the stairs, duck and start punching. He will appear and disappear, but JUST in front of you. Six punches and he's history.

5) FIFTH BOSS: Mainly keep him defending himself with high kicks (tapping very fast!) and then suddenly change to low kicks. Start with a jumping moving kick in the chest (just like the third boss) and then start the high/low kicks patterns.

Splatterhouse (c) 11/1988 Namco.


In a dark and stormy night, Rick and his girlfriend Jeniffer take refuge in the creepy West mansion, only to find himself dead and Jeniffer missing! Now, a mysterious sacrificial mask with amazing powers brings him back from the dead and in order to free himself from its curse, he must destroy the evil lurking deep within the mansion and save Jennifer in the process! Features some of the goriest graphics ever seen at its release date, awesome music & sound effects, lots of the typical toys seen in horror flicks (knives, etc) as well as lots of challenge!


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the Namco System 1 hardware.


The game was banned in most arcades in the US due to its violent nature as well as some questionable bosses such as the chapel boss (The inverted cross). Splatterhouse was the first game to get a parental advisory disclaimer.


Rick make a cameo appearance in "Point Blank 3".


Splatterhouse's developers seem to have been inspired by many known and a few not so known horror flicks such as...

* Friday the 13th movies: The third boss wears a bag for a mask just like Jason Voorhees did on the first three movies and Rick's mask resembles the well-know hockey mask that Jason wears in the later movies of the series until the Jason X movie in which he gets a totally different new look.

* Evil Dead movies: Many concepts were borrowed from these particular movies such as: House deep within the woods where a famed scientist unleshes some very evil demonic power; The fight between Rick and his evil twins; The evil severed hands that even taunt him; The possessed room with flying furniture; The necromancer's zombies that just won't die, Rick's quest to rescue Jennifer, only to find her possessed and turned into a cackling demon hungry for his blood!

* The Exorcist: When fighting against demon Jennifer, she recovers her sanity for a few brief moments and begs for your help just before turning into a demon once again, something quite similar is seen in this horror classic.

* H-man: The sludge monsters seen in the sewer levels seem somewhat similar to the liquid people seen in this old japanese horror flick.

* Poltergeist: The possesed room may also have been inspired by this movie.

* Parasite: The leeches seen at the end of the first stage as well as in many other later levels are clearly based in the creatures seen in this pseudo 3-D movie.

* Rejuvenator: The big headed monsters whose heads fly off and attack before dying are very reminiscent of the gruesome brain-eating monster seen in this movie.

Spy Hunter (c) 12/1983 Bally Midway.


- TRIVIA -

The car was based on one of the designer's own Nissan 280z. The game was to have a helicopter stage but the designers ran out of resources. They also wanted the James Bond theme to play, but settled for the Peter Gunn theme instead.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Here's A Great Cheat That Does Several Things At Once:

1) You need to have a supply truck available, and a be at a bridge-out level. When the detour appears, don't take it - instead, call up your truck.

2) Wait until the road has straightened out into the bridge and drive into the truck. When the truck pulls over and lets you out, stay on the side of the road, and SLOWLY drive up until you reach the gap in the bridge.

3) Drive on until you car is about half-way over the edge, and wait until the Enforcer comes along. He will try and get you, but he'll be unable to drive far enough to do so. At this point, I would get a friend to mind the game, while I went for a break. When I returned, I just drove across the bridge, flying mysteriously across the bridge out, until I reached the other side.

4) You will notice several differences to the game after this happens. The Enforcer no longer appears, the game gets no harder, and Dr. Torpedo no longer appears on water sections!

Star Castle (c) 09/1980 Cinematronics.


- TRIVIA -


Licensed to Mottoeis for Spanish manufacture and distribution.


A bootleg of this game is known as "Stellar Castle".


This was one of the first games to use an experimental artificial intelligence to harras the game player's ship. The star constellation in the background was actually the outline of a centerfold from a 1980 issue of OUI magazine. When management found out after shipping about 5000 units, they flipped out and almost stopped production. They eventually came to their senses and nothing was changed.


A Star Castle unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1982 movie 'Rocky III', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1986 movie 'Maximum Overdrive' and in the 1996 movie 'High School High'.

Star Force (c) 09/1984 Tehkan.


- TRIVIA -


This game is known in US as "Megaforce".


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* A Trick: You can determine which direction the end of level boss will move before it even appears by looking at your score. If the hundreds digit is odd, the boss will move to the left. If it is even, it'll move right (the tens and units digits are always zero).


* One Million Points Bonus: On the violet continent, if you see a coelacanth fossil on the left side, go to the -right- side and shoot. Cleopatra appears - shoot her and you'll get a million-point bonus. The coelacanth may only appear on the third violet continent.


* 80,000 Points Bonus: At some points in the game you will see two columns of green arrows down the center of the screen. Concentrate on either the left or right column of these arrows, and try to shoot 16 in a row. You will be awarded an 80,000 bonus for doing this. The first time these appear, it is possible to get two such bonuses in a row (if there are not many enemies around!), and sometimes more if the level ends before the column has finished appearing. Later on there is a short column of only 16, so only one bonus is possible here.


* 50,000 Point Bonus: You've seen a big enemy that combines into parts. When you hear the tune it is about to appear, STOP SHOOTING (You don't actually have to stop shooting altogether, but if you hit part of the enemy before the center part flashes white the bonus will not work). Position your ship so that you are just underneath the center part of the enemy and wait for it to flash white. Once this has happened, shoot the center part several times: the enemy will be destroyed and you will be awarded the 50,000 point special bonus.

The basic game engine for Star Wars was converted from a 2-year old space game project called 'Warp-Speed', which was designed to develop 3-D image capabilities. The controls were adapted from the controls used for Army "Battle Zone".


Star Wars was the first Atari game to have speech. All of the phrases were taken directly from the movie.


Hidden Ingame Message: Right after hitting the exhaust port on the 1st Death Star, the message 'May the Force be with You' appears on it. The next time around, all the programmers names appear. Successive rounds alternate the message.


Approximately 12,700 units were produced.


A sequel was planned as 'Star Wars II' the same year (idea form only) with a serial communication concept (link between 2 or more cabinets) - this idea never was born.


A Star Wars units appears in the 1984 movie 'Gremlins'.

Stargate (c) 11/1981 Williams.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the "Defender" hardware


While "Defender" was pretty hard, the sequel Stargate added another button! So Stargate had a total of six buttons and a joystick in use during game play!


Stargate was the first game designed by Vid kidz, the design firm founded by Jarvis and DeMar when they decided to go independent. Williams became desperate for a game after the designers left, so they took Vidkidz under contract. Stargate took four months to complete. All Vidkidz games were designed on a dual 8" floppy, 1 MHz 6809 Motorola Exorcisor system that cost $30,000 in those days. The name was changed to 'Defender II' right after the game had stopped being manufactured, because Williams wanted to make sure they could own the trademark on the title.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Secret Message: The formula consists of three sequences of buttons, that all must be completed within a quarter of a second of each other, without the player dying onscreen. The moves are as follows...

1) Joystick Down, Reverse, 1P Start and Thrust.

2) Reverse, 2P Start and Fire.

3) Joystick Down, 1P Start, Thrust and Fire.


* An Undocumented Feature: You need to have killed everything off in the wave except for one lander. There must be at least one humanoid on the ground. Wait for the lander to pick up the humanoid. Shoot the lander and catch the humanoid JUST before it hits the ground. The screen'll flash like mad and you will be awarded 2000, presumably for catching the humanoid and depositing it on the ground in the tiny interval before the wave ends.


* If you go in to the warp gate and press reverse and warp at the same time you will make the screen mess up. It will look like you are going super fast from left to right, kinda like a cardiograph at high speed. This will kill the game that you are playing.

Starship 1 (c) 07/1977 Atari.

Game ID: 007513-007531


- TRIVIA -


Starship 1 is another fantastic Atari first. This incredibly realistic video sensation (at its time) goes where no game has gone before.


3500 units were produced. The game uses a half-silvered mirror to reflect the image over a black light lit space background. The monitor has a '+' (a target crosshairs) taped directly onto the monitor to aid in lining up enemy ships.


At the end of a game, two various saying will be displayed. One simply saying to deposit a quarter to be the captain of Starship 1, the other say that 'Sensors detect another quarter in your pocket, deposit it to be the captain of Starship 1'. Pretty funny the first time you see it!


A Starship 1 unit appears in the 1978 movie 'Dawn of the Dead'.

The original! Ryu and Ken go after ten of the world's toughest brawlers. You've got a lot to learn before you defeat me!


- TRIVIA -


Capcom's first one-on-one fighting game.


The original location test version of this game used pressure sensitive pads (Mechatronics) to measure the three strengths of attack used in the game - the bonus stages were unregulated tests of strength where the harder you hit the pad, the more you would score. You can imagine how much abuse the machines took, apparently one individual climbed up on top of the machine and drop kicked it to get a high score. After a large number of injuries and a high damage bill, Capcom replaced the system with individual buttons for each strength - the now common 6 button layout.


'Ryu' can mean 'dragon' and 'Ken' mean 'fist' or 'punch'. The two names together roughly make the phrase 'dragon punch'. The dragon punch move has been copied over and over in most if not all subsequent fighting games released.


Ryu and Sagat were mostly based on 'Yoshiji Soeno', a 'Kyokushin Karate legend' and 'Reiba', the 'Dark Lord of Muaythai' from an old Japanese martial art comics called 'Karate Baka Ichidai'.


Mike Bison is Capcom's homage to Mike Tyson.


Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Capcom Game Music Vol.2 - 28XA-203) on 25/03/1988.

Street Fighter - The Movie (c) 06/1995 Incredible Technologies.


Surprisingly competent and fast-paced digitized fighter based on the incredibly horrible movie, featuring fourteen selectable characters.


- TRIVIA -


This game tanked in arcades for two reasons. The first being that the Street Fighter live-action movie that this game is based on was universally panned by moviegoers and video game fans alike (read: the movie was TERRIBLE). The second reason was that many diehard Street Fighter fans just didn't find the digitized characters appealing, as they lacked the initial charm of the original sprites. What was overlooked, however, was that this is a decent fighting game in its own right and failed due to poor marketing and public squeamishness.


The arcade game mark's Raul Julia's second appearance in coin-ops, the first being the highly popular Addams Family pinball table. This makes him a member of a very exclusive club within arcade games: a man who lent his likeness and talents to a commercial triumph and a turkey within 5 years.


In the SFTM game, you can have Fei Long's theme as a secret theme, but Fei Long himself has no connections to the movie whatsoever. Why is that? According to documents at the time, the role that Fei Long was going to play was replaced by Captain Sawada, largely because there was not enough character development for Fei Long in SSF2.

Street Fighter Alpha - Warriors' Dreams (c) 06/1995 Capcom.

Game ID: CP-S II No. 11


The new look of the Street Fighter series, with ten characters including old favorites and new surprises.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and six buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game is known in Japan and Spain as "Street Fighter Zero".


This game runs on the Capcom Play System II hardware (CPS II).


The Street Fighter Alpha series of games take place between the original "Street Fighter" and "Street Fighter II". The scar on Sagat's chest in "Street Fighter II" is said to be from Ryu's Shouryuuken during the final battle in "Street Fighter". In 'SF Alpha', Sagat has the scar on his chest, so it must take place after the first "Street Fighter". The character Nash was mentioned in Guile's ending in "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" (Nash's name was changed to Charlie in the US). He is a friend of Guile who was killed by Vega. Since Nash is still alive in the Alpha series, it must take place before "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior".


Ryu / Guy stages:

The "Son Son" convenience store in Ryu and Guy's stages is named after an earlier Capcom game of the same name.

A "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" poster can be seen in the window of this store.

The kanji on the small sign on the bath-house means 'Honda Bath'.

The curtain on the bath-house (in Guy's version of the stage) says 'yu' in hiragana, which is the reading for the 'bath' kanji on the 'Honda Bath' sign.

In "Street Fighter Alpha 3", Edmond Honda's stage is in front of this (or a similar-looking) bath-house with slightly different signs on it.

In "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior", Honda's stage is inside of a bath house.


Guy and Sodom are from Capcom's "Final Fight". Guy as selectable character and Sodom as the second boss in "Final Fight". Guy's and Rolento's music are taken from "Final Fight".


Sodom is a westerner who is obsessed with Japanese culture and apparently doesn't speak Japanese very well. In the Japanese versions of these games, Sodom's victory quotes are meaningless sentences composed of English words (e.g., 'SHOW BY HUNG JAW') followed by a Japanese translation of what he actually meant to say. In Sodom's ending, he claims about reforming and renaming the Mad Gear gang into something with four kanji. Those kanji read 'Ma-do-gi-a'. Now this could just be random kanji that, when strung together, sound like 'Mad Gear', but by the same token, it can sound like 'Mad Doggie'. The jitte weapons Sodom uses were used by policemen in feudal Japan.


Change of Race: In "Street Fighter", Birdie looked caucasian. In SF Alpha, Birdie is black. The reason for this change is explained in one of Birdie's SFA3 winquotes (he was sick at the time of "Street Fighter") - just yet another excuse of covering up one of SF's (many) plotholes.


SME released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Street Fighter Zero Arcade Game Track - SRCL-3297) on 21/08/1995.

In the Japanese version, Charlie is named 'Nash'.

Street Fighter Alpha 2 (c) 03/1996 Capcom.

Game ID: CP-S II No. 15


Eighteen Alpha fighters go head-to-head this time around, featuring a few Final Fight alumni.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and six buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game is known in Japan and Asia as "Street Fighter Zero 2".


This game runs on the Capcom Play System II hardware (CPS II).


Guy, Rolento and Sodom are from Capcom's "Final Fight". Guy as selectable character, Sodom as the second boss and Rolento as the fourth boss in "Final Fight". Guy's and Rolento's music are taken from "Final Fight".


In Guy's stage you will see many familiar faces from "Final Fight". There's Mike and Jessica Haggar, Cody, Poison, Andorre and a few other bosses in the background - most of the Final Fight characters that have gone on to other games are there.


Here is a list of cameo in Ken's Yacht stage:

* Eliza (It's her birthday afterall!)

* Captain Commando & Sho

* Strider Hiryu (wielding a teddy bear!)

* Lynn Kurosawa (from Alien Vs Predator)

* Morrigan, Felicia, Lord Raptor & Hsien-Ko (these last two are pretty much alive in this cameo, unlike in the Darkstalkers & Vampire Savior games!) :)

* Michelle Heart (from Legendary Wings as another waitress!)

* A few thugs from Final Fight (working as waiters?!!!)


Dan Hibiki, the pink-clad Shotokan fighter, was an attempt by Capcom to make fun of SNK fighting games. Ryo Sakazaki was thought to be so much like Ryu that Capcom had to make a statement. Dan is mainly a hybrid of Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia from the Art of Fighting series. This is most evident in his appearance in which he has Robert Garcia's trademark pony tail and Ryo Sakazaki's black undershirt. His animations were heavily tailored to look like a take on the aforemetioned characters. Dan's father was killed by Sagat (This is the man who Sagat hits with a Tiger Uppercut during the Ryu vs. Sagat intro in Alpha 3), so Dan developed his own style of fighting called 'Saikyo-ryuu', which is Japanese for 'strongest style', a poke at the "Art of Fighting" 'Kyokugen' karate style ('Kyokugen" is Japanese for 'extreme'). Fei Long makes a guest appearance in Dan's stage.


The sumo wrestler 'Fujinoyama' that Sodom challenges in his ending had so much of a resemblance to E. Honda that Capcom, for Alpha 3, changed it to E. Honda.


The Australian prairie stage where Sagat fights Ryu is based on the opening scene of the animated 'Street Fighter II Movie', in which Ryu and Sagat fight in a prairie during a thunderstorm.


Victor Entertainment released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Street Fighter Zero 2: Capcom Game Soundtrack - VIZL-24) on 21/06/1996.


- UPDATES -


In the Japanese version, specific locations are displayed on the 'next stage' screen. The American version just tells you which country the stage is in. Perhaps someone at Capcom USA was too lazy to translate the location-specific text (which is in Japanese) and just used the country name (which is in English). Below are the place names that were left out of the American version, translated into English...

(Character: Stage location)

Ryu: Suzaku Castle, Japan

(Sagat vs.) Ryu: a big prairie, Australia

Ken: San Francisco Bay, USA

Chun-Li: Beijing, China

Sagat: Ayuthaya Temple Ruins, Thailand

Adon: Bank of the Chao Phraya River, Thailand

Birdie: London Station Underground, England

Nash: Detroit Highway, USA

Guy: Metro City, USA

Rose: Genova City Port, Italy

Sodom: Arizona Desert, USA

Vega: Atop the VTOL, Brazil

(Nash vs.) Vega: Guiana Highlands - Great Waterfalls, Venezuela

Gouki: Gokuentou <Hellfire Island>, Japan

Dan: Temple Street, Hong Kong

Dhalsim: Bank of the Ganges River, India

Zangief: Bilsk Steelworks, USSR

Gen: Shanghai, China

Rolento: New York, USA

Sakura: Setagaya-ku, 2-Choume, Tokyo, Japan


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Alternate Costume Colors: Highlight a fighter at the character selection screenand press LK, MK or HK.


* Alternate Chun-Li Costumes: Hold Start and highlight Chun-Li at the character selection screen. After five seconds, press LP, MP, or HP for a blue costume (without trousers); press LP+MP+HP for a pink costume.


* Play As Satsui no Hadou ni Mezameta Ryuu (Translates as 'Ryu in which the surge of the intent to kill has awakened'): Highlight Ryu at the character selection screen, then press Start. Then highlight Adon, Akuma, Adon, then return to Ryu. Hold Start for five seconds, then press any attack button.


* Grass Stage: Select two player mode. Hold Start at the character selection screen, then highlight Sagat for five seconds. Then highlight any character, release Start and press any attack button.


* Waterfall Stage: Select two player mode. Hold Start at the character selection screen, then highlight M. Bison for five seconds. Then highlight any character, release Start and press any attack button.


* Sari In Every Stage: In Dhalsim's stage you may have noticed a girl who cheers for him. That is Sari, his wife. When you play as Dhalsim, its possible to make her appear on every fight by holding down LP+HK before the fight starts (You must do this at the begining of every round).


* Alternate Sodom Stage: An alternate version of Sodom's stage appears every 4096 matches. The artwork on his truck is different. The Japanese text is replaced with English and the man on the side of the trailer is now wearing sunglasses. This alternate version of the stage is the one used in Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha.

Street Fighter Alpha 3 (c) 06/1998 Capcom.

Game ID: CP-S II No. 29


Twenty-five fighters mix it up to have a shot at Shin Bison in the height of his power! Featuring three fighting styles for each character.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and six buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game is known in Japan and Asia as "Street Fighter Zero 3".


This game runs on the Capcom Play System II hardware (CPS II).


Guy, Cody, Sodom and Rolento are from Capcom's "Final Fight". Guy and Cody as selectable characters, Sodom as the second boss and Rolento as the fourth boss in "Final Fight". "Final Fight" boss 'Edi E' makes appearances in some of Cody's finishing poses. The reason for Mike Haggar's (the third selectable character in "Final Fight") non-appearance in Street Fighter was that he was too similar to Zangief. Furthermore, it could be because during the "Street Fighter Alpha" storyline, Mike Haggar was assumed to be the mayor of Metro City (a part of New York) at the time.


In Guy's stage there is a group from Final Fight cheering Guy on. They consist of: Mike Haggar, Andorre Jr., Axl and poison. Also in the background against one of the buildings there is a advert for a Megaman Drink just under the Capcom Logo.


Karin Kanzuki is the first Street Fighter to have originated from a comic book (actually, a manga). She first appeared in a girls' manga that had Sakura Kasugano as the main character.


The three ISMs have some symbolic meaning:

* X represents Super Street Fighter II X, or for non-Japanese audiences, Super Street Fighter II Turbo. That is, this ISM matches closely to the gameplay style found therein. There are, however, a few differences between X-ISM in Alpha 3 and Super Street Fighter II Turbo, mainly because of the Alpha 3 game engine.

* Z (or A for non-Japanese audiences) represents Zero (or Alpha). That is, it is closest to the style of the previous Alpha games.

* V stands for Variable, as in 'Variable Combination', meaning 'Custom Combo'. This merely represents how you can use your super bar.


Attack of the Bison Dolls: Each Bison doll is named after a month of the year in the language of their supposed origin. It is said that they wield different tools, but generally share the same style. It is said that they generally worked as a team.

1) Enero (January) from Spain uses a microphone.

2) Fevrier (February) from France uses a gun.

3) Marz (March) from Germany uses a laptop and dyes her hair. Enero and Marz are the information and recon members of the team.

4) Aprile (April) from Italy is the medical member of the team. At the beginning of SFA3, Aprile's brother had asked Rose to find her whereabouts.

5) Satsuki (May) is Japanese and wields a sword. Some say Sakura was supposed to be kidnapped instead of Satsuki, but Sakura evaded capture. This belief is consistent with the fact that all 12 dolls (and Cammy) were 16 at the time of SFA3.

6) Juni (June) is German and fights unarmed.

7) Juli (July) is also German and also fights unarmed. Despite the claims of some sources, Juni and Juli are not related (none of the Bison dolls are).

8) Santamu (August) is Vietnamese, but of African heritage. She wields a spear and can also unleash a small monkey to attack for her.

9) Xiayu (September) is Chinese and wields the nunchaku.

10) Jianyu (October) is also Chinese and wields a staff.

11) Noembelu (November) is Mexican and is a member of T. Hawk's tribe (thus T. Hawk was looking for her and not Juli as the story implied). She wields a pair of hatchets on ropes.

12) Decapre (December) is Russian and her appearance is similar to that of Cammy.


Cammy had tried to save the Bison dolls in her SFA3 ending because, due to the extent of their brainwashing, they would have died with Bison otherwise. It is said that the inspiration of the Bison dolls was Yuka Minakawa's novels named collectively as 'Cammy History'. Before the fight, Cammy throws a red coat, this comes from "Street Fighter 2" the Animated Movie.


Suleputer released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Street Fighter Zero 3 Original Soundtrack - CPCA-1012, 1013) on 21/09/1998.


- UPDATES -


In the Japanese version, Rainbow Mika is named 'Mika Nanakawa'.


The early revision (06/98) had two bugs involving Karin: First, she could do her Kanzuki-ryuu Kou'ou Ken super in X-ISM (which she shouldn't be able to do, as it was her second super). Second, Karin's normal throw in Mazi Mode could do 99% damage.


In the Japanese version, specific locations were given for each stage (in Japanese) along with the name of the country (in English). Only the country name is given in the American verison (Alpha 3), with the more specific info being removed instead of being translated. Here is the list:

Adon: Khmer Historic Ruins, Thailand

Gouki: Oni Fang Cave, Japan

M. Bison, Vega, Juni & Juli: Secret Point 48106 (since there was no country given for 'Secret Point 48106', its name is left completely blank in the American version)

Birdie: Train Cemetery, England

Blanka: Madeira River branch - swampland, Brazil

Cammy: Mikonos Island, Greece

Nash: Frankfort Hangar, U.S.A.

Chun-Li: Zhidan Plaza, China

Zangief: Akademu Gorodowa blast furnace, U.S.S.R.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Title Color Chart: The color of the title screen denotes what secrets are currently available. After a few weeks of play, the title screen will change color, so in a few months after your SFA3 machine has been installed, it should reach the final color (light blue). The explanation of the colors is shown below:

Cream - (default color)

Green - Classical Mode

Red - Balrog, Juni and Juli become playable

Dark Blue - Mazi Mode

Purple - Saikyou Mode

Light Blue - Can select one of the three Battle Modes


* Random Select: The Random Select squares are normally invisible. But, there are two for the first player and two for the second. The 1P squares are located in the upper-right corner of the diamond and the lower-right. The 2P squares are in the upper-left corner and the lower-left corners.


* Hidden Characters: The three hidden charactes are Balrog, the boxer and Juni and Juli, two prototype 'dolls' created by Bison's Shadowloo organization. Once the game's title screen has become the proper color (see 'Title Color Chart', above), their score listing will show up in the High Score listing and they become playable...

1) To choose Balrog, pause on Karin for five seconds, then move to any Random Select square, hold the Start button and press any button.

2) To use Juli, pause on Karin for five seconds, then move to any Random Select square. If the square is on the left side of the screen, choose her by holding Left and pressing any button. If the square is on the right side, then hold Right and press any button instead.

3) To use Juni, pause on Karin for five seconds, then move to any Random Select square. If the square is on the top of the screen, choose her by holding Up and pressing any button. If the square is on the bottom, then hold Down and press any button instead.


* Hidden Modes Of Play: There are three secret modes that affect basic gameplay. Once the game's title screen has become the proper color (see 'Title Color Chart', above), you can select a hidden mode to use...

1) To use Classical Mode, insert your coin, hold down HP+HK and press Start. You can release HP+HK once you're at the Player Select Screen. Then, pick your character. When you start the round your super power bar will be gone and you will have Street Fighter 2 moves.

2) To use Mazi Mode, insert your coin, hold down MP+MK and press Start. You can release HP+HK once you're at the Player Select Screen. Then, pick your character.

3) To use Saikyou Mode, insert your coin, hold down LP+LK and press Start. You can release HP+HK once you're at the Player Select Screen. Then, pick your character.


* Hidden Battle Mode: Once the game's title screen has become the proper color (see 'Title Color Chart', above), you can select a hidden battle mode...

1) Final battle mode: After picking your ISM, hold Start+LP+MK+HP. You'll fight Final Bison for one battle only. It's just like the last battle; win and you get your ending, lose and you get the bad ending.

2) Dramatic battle mode: Hold LK+MK+HK, then press Start. Keep holding those buttons at Player Select Screen for a moment. You'll fight a 2 on 1 battle for 6 rounds, in which you face two CPU-controlled opponents.

3) Survival mode: Insert your coin(s), hold LP+MP+HP and press Start. Keep holding those buttons at Player Select Screen. You'll get to fight all 27 characters in continuous one-round battles.


* Secret Messages (This trick only works on Japanese SFZ3 machines): After winning a battle, press and hold Start as well as any other button. Between battles, a message will appear on the screen, depending on the button you're holding.


* Sari In Every Stage: In Dhalsim's stage you may have noticed a girl who cheers for him. That is Sari, his wife. When you play as Dhalsim, its possible to make her appear on every fight by holding down LP+HK before the fight starts (You must do this at the begining of every round).


* Alternate Sodom BGM: When fighting against Sodom (VS o CPU, you'll get to hear a different tune if it is on X-ism mode. Apparently the tune is inspired on his boss tune in "Final Fight".

Street Fighter II - The World Warrior (c) 02/1991 Capcom.

Game ID: CP-S No. 14


The entire fighting game phenomenon sprang forth directly from these eight selectable World Warriors and four boss characters. You could always tell that an arcade had Street Fighter II because you could hear the elephants roar loud and clear in Dhalsim's stage.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and six buttons.


- TRIVIA -


During the development of SFII (and before the release of "Final Fight"), the very first free-hand drawing was done in the fall of 1988. At this time, eight prototype characters and an Island design was drawn. Just like the world map of the final version, the island would scroll on-screen to show the next destination, culminating at the top of the island.


This game runs on the Capcom Play System hardware (CPS).


With the rapid success of SFII, it was rumored that Mattel, the makers of Barbie, had sued Capcom for using the name Ken since people would confuse our Street Fighter with that of Barbie's boyfriend. As such, Capcom gave a last name to Ken.


Fans of Street Fighter are well accustomed to the story of Sheng Long. Street Fighter II was already well popular in the arcades when the April issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly came out. There was a story about a secret character in SFII. His name: Sheng Long, the supposed master of Ryu and Ken. To reach him, you had to go a certain amount of matches against Bison without touching him. If that condition was fulfilled, Sheng Long would come up and kill Bison and you would fight him instead. His style was essentially a mix of Ryu's and Ken's styles, but was much faster and dealt much more damage. When the issue came out, millions literally pumped quarters into SFII machines, trying to get to this nonexistent character. Capcom had neither confirmed nor denied the Sheng Long story and it was only much later that EGM themselves admitted that it was just an April Fools' joke... or was it? 'Sheng Long' is the Chinese pronunciation of 'Shou Ryuu' (as in Shou Ryuu Ken).


For some reason, instead of writing 'Shou Ryuu Ken' or the English translation ('Rising Dragon Fist'), Capcom used the Chinese pronunciation of just the 'Shou Ryuu' part of 'Shou Ryuu Ken' for Ryu's victory quote: 'You must defeat Sheng Long to stand a chance'. People who saw this victory quote were understandably confused as to who or what this 'Sheng Long' was referring to.


Mike the Bison...: Many have conjectured whether Mike from "Street Fighter" is the same as Balrog (Mike Bison) from SFII. While Capcom of Japan confirms this, Capcom of America denies this (mainly from the possiblity of a Mike Tyson lawsuit). In Japan, as long as you change the name, you can basically rip off/make homage to a character and it would be treated as an original creation (in America it would be some form of copyright/identity theft). Ironically, as a result of the name change, Vega is a better fitting name for the Spanish warrior (Balrog has its roots in Nordic mythology, while Vega is a Hispanic name).


Street Fighter merchandise: During SF's height of popularity (basically during the SF2 years), various pieces of merchandise were released, some relating to SFII and some relating to the SF movie. A quick rundown:

* SFII boardgame (1994, MB (Milton bradley)) - Control one of six world warriors as they try to defeat Bison before time runs out (you do have one mover per World Warrior, but the board only has enough space for six).

* SFTM Street Striker - One of many SFTM related merchandise (largely souped-up military equipment and Shadaloo base sets).


Mikhail Gorbachev, former Russian prime minister, appears in Zangief's ending.


Chun-Li means 'Spring Beauty'.


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Street Fighter II: G.S.M. Capcom 4 - PCCB-00056) on 21/03/1991.


A Street Fighter II unit appears in the 2002 movie 'Friday After Next'.


- UPDATES -


Name changes between Japanese and US/World version:

* Mike Bison - Balrog

* Balrog - Vega

* Vega - Major Bison


None of the endings are translated 100% accurately from Japanese to English, but most are pretty close:

* Blanka's ending: In the US version, Blanka's mother says that he was lost when his plane crashed in Brazil when he was a baby.

In the Japanese version there is no explanation of how, when, or where mother and son were separated.

Since the anklets she gave to Jimmy BEFORE they were separated still fit him, he was probably not supposed to be a baby when he was lost.

* Chun-Li's ending: Chun-Li refers to Vega's organization as 'the organization of evil' in the Japanese version.

In the US version, she calls it 'Bison's drug'.

This was probably supposed to be 'drug ring', as the word 'ring' was added in later versions of the game.

There is no mention of drugs in the Japanese version.

* Dhalsim's ending: Dhalsim says that the photograph is of him a long time ago.

In the US version, he says it is him 'in his past life'.

Since only three years had passed, he obviously didn't actually mean that he had died and been reincarnated since the photograph had been taken.

* Guile's ending: In the US version, Guile's wife's name was changed from Julia to Jane.

His daughter was given the name Amy (She was not mentioned by name in the Japanese version, but her name is Chris).

Guile's dead friend Nash was renamed Charlie.

In the US version, Guile asks 'Bison' if he remembers: him (Guile), him and 'Charlie' and Cambodia.

'Bison' says he remembers and that Guile was not the runt he was then.

None of this is said in the Japanese version.

In the US version, after his wife 'Jane' stops Guile from killing 'Bison', she says that killing him won't bring 'Charlie' back, only make Guile a murderer, just like Bison.

In the Japanese version, Julia only says that killing Vega won't bring Nash back.

She does not say that it would make him a murderer.

* Special Ending: Finish the game on one quarter to see additional credit sequence.


* To Get Ryu vs. Ryu: Start a fresh game on the left side (1P). Select any character other than Ryu. Play the game until you reach Ryu. Lose. Join in the game on the other side and hit 2P BEFORE the timer runs out. Select Ryu and enjoy fighting Ryu.

LCD handheld game (19??) released by Tiger Electronics: It's basically a stripped down version of SFII, made to fit on a portable unit. You have two 'game types', basically whether you want to control either the character on the left or the character on the right. The player on the left could choose between Ryu, Ken and Guile, while the right-hand character could be one of Blanka, E. Honda and Zangief. Players could control the characters on a 'simplified layout' (ie. two buttons). Although special moves exist, keep in mind it's an LCD game - there aren't many (in fact Ryu and Ken are the only characters with two moves).

An enhanced version of "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior":

* Added an alternate color scheme for each character and the ability to select boss characters (Vega, M. Bison, Balrog, Sagat).

* Each stage had different background colors from the original (mainly time of day changes).

* New moves were added for some characters.

* Chun Li and Vega's portraits have been recolored.

* Overall hit damage was reduced (favoring combos attacks instead of special moves).

* Special moves were tweaked a bit (ie: the fighting styles of Ryu and Ken were distinguishable from one another)

* The main title screen was changed from black to blue.

* Various cosmetic enhancements were made to each character's physical appearance.

* In the original SF2, Ryu's stage featured breakable 'Fuurinkazan' <Wind-Forest-Fire-Mountain> signs. These signs have been removed in this game and are never seen again in any of the subsequent versions of SF2.

* In Ken's stage in SF2 there were two barrels and a stack of boxes which were a single breakable item. In this game the there is just a single barrel in Ken's stage.

* Sagat's SF2 stage had a palm tree in the foreground. The palm tree is gone in this game and does not return.

Street Fighter Zero (c) 06/1995 Capcom.

Game ID: CP-S II No. 11


The new look of the Street Fighter series, with ten characters including old favorites and new surprises.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick ad six buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game is known outside Japan as "Street Fighter Alpha - Warriors' Dreams".


This game runs on the Capcom Play System II hardware (CPS II).


The SF Zero series of games take place between the original "Street Fighter" and "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior". The scar on Sagat's chest in "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" is said to be from Ryu's Shouryuuken during the final battle in "Street Fighter". In SF Zero, Sagat has the scar on his chest, so it must take place after the first "Street Fighter". The character Nash was mentioned in Guile's ending in "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" (Nash's name was changed to Charlie in the US). He is a friend of Guile who was killed by Vega. Since Nash is still alive in the Zero series, it must take place before "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior".


Ryu / Guy stages:

The "Son Son" convenience store in Ryu and Guy's stages is named after an earlier Capcom game of the same name.

A "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" poster can be seen in the window of this store.

The kanji on the small sign on the bath-house means 'Honda Bath'.

The curtain on the bath-house (in Guy's version of the stage) says 'yu' in hiragana, which is the reading for the 'bath' kanji on the 'Honda Bath' sign.

In "Street Fighter Zero 3", Edmond Honda's stage is in front of this (or a similar-looking) bath-house with slightly different signs on it.

In "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior", Honda's stage is inside of a bath house.


Guy and Sodom are from Capcom's "Final Fight". Guy as selectable character and Sodom as the second boss in "Final Fight". Guy's and Rolento's music are taken from "Final Fight".


Sodom is a westerner who is obsessed with Japanese culture and apparently doesn't speak Japanese very well. In the Japanese versions of these games, Sodom's victory quotes are meaningless sentences composed of English words (e.g., 'SHOW BY HUNG JAW') followed by a Japanese translation of what he actually meant to say. In Sodom's ending, he claims about reforming and renaming the Mad Gear gang into something with four kanji. Those kanji read 'Ma-do-gi-a'. Now this could just be random kanji that, when strung together, sound like 'Mad Gear', but by the same token, it can sound like 'Mad Doggie'. The jitte weapons Sodom uses were used by policemen in feudal Japan.


Change of Race: In "Street Fighter", Birdie looked caucasian. In SF Alpha, Birdie is black. The reason for this change is explained in one of Birdie's "Street Fighter Zero 3" winquotes (he was sick at the time of "Street Fighter") - just yet another excuse of covering up one of SF's (many) plotholes.


SME released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Street Fighter Zero Arcade Game Track - SRCL-3297) on 21/08/1995.


- UPDATES -


In the non-Japanese version, Nash is named 'Charlie'.

Street Fighter Zero 2 (c) 02/1996 Capcom.

Game ID: CP-S II No. 15


Eighteen Alpha fighters go head-to-head this time around, featuring a few "Final Fight" alumni.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and six buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game is known in US as "Street Fighter Alpha 2".


This game runs on the Capcom Play System II hardware (CPS II).


Guy, Rolento and Sodom are from Capcom's "Final Fight". Guy as selectable character, Sodom as the second boss and Rolento as the fourth boss in "Final Fight". Guy's and Rolento's music are taken from "Final Fight".

In Guy's stage you will see many familiar faces from "Final Fight". There's Mike and Jessica Haggar, Cody, Poison, Andorre and a few other bosses in the background - most of the "Final Fight" characters that have gone on to other games are there.


Here is a list of cameo in Ken's Yacht stage:

* Eliza (It's her birthday afterall!)

* "Captain Commando" & Sho

* "Strider Hiryu" (wielding a teddy bear!)

* Lynn Kurosawa (from Alien Vs Predator)

* Morrigan, Felicia, Lord Raptor & Hsien-Ko (these last two are pretty much alive in this cameo, unlike in the Darkstalkers & Vampire Savior games!) :)

* Michelle Heart (from "Legendary Wings" as another waitress!)

* A few thugs from "Final Fight" (working as waiters?!!!)


Dan Hibiki, the pink-clad Shotokan fighter, was an attempt by Capcom to make fun of SNK fighting games. Ryo Sakazaki was thought to be so much like Ryu that Capcom had to make a statement. Dan is mainly a hybrid of Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia from the "Art of Fighting" series. This is most evident in his appearance in which he has Robert Garcia's trademark pony tail and Ryo Sakazaki's black undershirt. His animations were heavily tailored to look like a take on the aforemetioned characters. Dan's father was killed by Sagat (This is the man who Sagat hits with a Tiger Uppercut during the Ryu vs. Sagat intro in "Street Fighter Zero 3"), so Dan developed his own style of fighting called 'Saikyo-ryuu', which is Japanese for 'strongest style', a poke at the "Art of Fighting" 'Kyokugen' karate style ('Kyokugen' is Japanese for 'extreme'). Fei Long makes a guest appearance in Dan's stage.


The sumo wrestler 'Fujinoyama' that Sodom challenges in his ending had so much of a resemblance to E. Honda that Capcom, for "Street Fighter Zero 3", changed it to E. Honda.


The Australian prairie stage where Sagat fights Ryu is based on the opening scene of the animated 'Street Fighter II Movie', in which Ryu and Sagat fight in a prairie during a thunderstorm.


Victor Entertainment released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Street Fighter Zero 2: Capcom Game Soundtrack - VIZL-24) on 21/06/1996.


- UPDATES -


In the Japanese version, specific locations are displayed on the 'next stage' screen. The American version just tells you which country the stage is in. Perhaps someone at Capcom USA was too lazy to translate the location-specific text (which is in Japanese) and just used the country name (which is in English). Below are the place names that were left out of the American version, translated into English...

(Character: Stage location)

Ryu: Suzaku Castle, Japan

(Sagat vs.) Ryu: a big prairie, Australia

Ken: San Francisco Bay, USA

Chun-Li: Beijing, China

Adon: Bank of the Chao Phraya River, Thailand

Birdie: London Station Underground, England

Nash: Detroit Highway, USA

Guy: Metro City, USA

Rose: Genova City Port, Italy

Sodom: Arizona Desert, USA

Vega: Atop the VTOL, Brazil

Zangief: Bilsk Steelworks, USSR

Gen: Shanghai, China

Rolento: New York, USA

Sakura: Setagaya-ku, 2-Choume, Tokyo, Japan


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Alternate Costume Colors: Highlight a fighter at the character selection screenand press LK, MK or HK.


* Alternate Chun-Li Costumes: Hold Start and highlight Chun-Li at the character selection screen. After five seconds, press LP, MP, or HP for a blue costume (without trousers); press LP+MP+HP for a pink costume.


* Play As Satsui no Hadou ni Mezameta Ryuu (Translates as 'Ryu in which the surge of the intent to kill has awakened'): Highlight Ryu at the character selection screen, then press Start. Then highlight Adon, Akuma, Adon, then return to Ryu. Hold Start for five seconds, then press any attack button.


* Grass Stage: Select two player mode. Hold Start at the character selection screen, then highlight Sagat for five seconds. Then highlight any character, release Start and press any attack button.


* Waterfall Stage: Select two player mode. Hold Start at the character selection screen, then highlight M. Bison for five seconds. Then highlight any character, release Start and press any attack button.


* Sari In Every Stage: In Dhalsim's stage you may have noticed a girl who cheers for him. That is Sari, his wife. When you play as Dhalsim, its possible to make her appear on every fight by holding down LP+HK before the fight starts (You must do this at the begining of every round).


* Alternate Sodom Stage: An alternate version of Sodom's stage appears every 4096 matches. The artwork on his truck is different. The Japanese text is replaced with English and the man on the side of the trailer is now wearing sunglasses. This alternate version of the stage is the one used in Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha.

Street Fighter Zero 3 (c) 06/1998 Capcom.

Game ID: CP-S II No. 29


Twenty-five fighters mix it up to have a shot at Shin Bison in the height of his power! Featuring three fighting styles for each character.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and six buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game is known outside Japan as "Street Fighter Alpha 3".


This game runs on the Capcom Play System II hardware (CPS II).


Guy, Cody, Sodom and Rolento are from Capcom's "Final Fight". Guy and Cody as selectable characters, Sodom as the second boss and Rolento as the fourth boss in "Final Fight". "Final Fight" boss 'Edi E' makes appearances in some of Cody's finishing poses.


The reason for Mike Haggar's (the third selectable character in "Final Fight") non-appearance in "Street Fighter" was that he was too similar to Zangief. Furthermore, it could be because during the "Street Fighter Zero" storyline, Mike Haggar was assumed to be the mayor of Metro City (a part of New York) at the time.


In Guy's stage there is a group from "Final Fight" cheering Guy on. They consist of: Mike Haggar, Andorre Jr., Axl and poison. Also in the background against one of the buildings there is a advert for a Megaman Drink just under the Capcom Logo.


Karin Kanzuki is the first Street Fighter to have originated from a comic book (actually, a manga). She first appeared in a girls' manga that had Sakura Kasugano as the main character.


The three ISMs have some symbolic meaning:

* X represents "Super Street Fighter II X", or for non-Japanese audiences, "Super Street Fighter II Turbo". That is, this ISM matches closely to the gameplay style found therein. There are, however, a few differences between X-ISM in Zero 3 and "Super Street Fighter II Turbo", mainly because of the Zero 3 game engine.

* Z (or A for non-Japanese audiences) represents Zero (or Alpha). That is, it is closest to the style of the previous Alpha games.

* V stands for Variable, as in 'Variable Combination', meaning 'Custom Combo'. This merely represents how you can use your super bar.


Attack of the Bison Dolls: Each Bison doll is named after a month of the year in the language of their supposed origin. It is said that they wield different tools, but generally share the same style. It is said that they generally worked as a team.

1) Enero (January) from Spain uses a microphone.

2) Fevrier (February) from France uses a gun.

3) Marz (March) from Germany uses a laptop and dyes her hair. Enero and Marz are the information and recon members of the team.

4) Aprile (April) from Italy is the medical member of the team. At the beginning of SFZ3, Aprile's brother had asked Rose to find her whereabouts.

5) Satsuki (May) is Japanese and wields a sword. Some say Sakura was supposed to be kidnapped instead of Satsuki, but Sakura evaded capture. This belief is consistent with the fact that all 12 dolls (and Cammy) were 16 at the time of SFA3.

6) Juni (June) is German and fights unarmed.

7) Juli (July) is also German and also fights unarmed. Despite the claims of some sources, Juni and Juli are not related (none of the Bison dolls are).

8) Santamu (August) is Vietnamese, but of African heritage. She wields a spear and can also unleash a small monkey to attack for her.

9) Xiayu (September) is Chinese and wields the nunchaku.

10) Jianyu (October) is also Chinese and wields a staff.

11) Noembelu (November) is Mexican and is a member of T. Hawk's tribe (thus T. Hawk was looking for her and not Juli as the story implied). She wields a pair of hatchets on ropes.

12) Decapre (December) is Russian and her appearance is similar to that of Cammy.


Cammy had tried to save the Bison dolls in her SFZ3 ending because, due to the extent of their brainwashing, they would have died with Bison otherwise. It is said that the inspiration of the Bison dolls was Yuka Minakawa's novels named collectively as 'Cammy History'. Before the fight, Cammy throws a red coat, this comes from Street Fighter 2 the Animated Movie.


Suleputer released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Street Fighter Zero 3 Original Soundtrack - CPCA-1012, 1013) on 21/09/1998.


- UPDATES -


In the non-Japanese version, Mika Nanakawa is named 'Rainbow Mika'.


The early revision (06/98) had two bugs involving Karin: First, she could do her Kanzuki-ryuu Kou'ou Ken super in X-ISM (which she shouldn't be able to do, as it was her second super). Second, Karin's normal throw in Mazi Mode could do 99% damage.


In the Japanese version, specific locations were given for each stage (in Japanese) along with the name of the country (in English). Only the country name is given in the American verison (Alpha 3), with the more specific info being removed instead of being translated. Here is the list:

Adon: Khmer Historic Ruins, Thailand

Gouki: Oni Fang Cave, Japan

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Title Color Chart: The color of the title screen denotes what secrets are currently available. After a few weeks of play, the title screen will change color, so in a few months after your SFA3 machine has been installed, it should reach the final color (light blue). The explanation of the colors is shown below...

Cream - (default color)

Green - Classical Mode

Red - Balrog, Juni and Juli become playable

Dark Blue - Mazi Mode

Purple - Saikyou Mode

Light Blue - Can select one of the three Battle Modes


* Random Select: The Random Select squares are normally invisible. But, there are two for the first player and two for the second. The 1P squares are located in the upper-right corner of the diamond and the lower-right. The 2P squares are in the upper-left corner and the lower-left corners.


* Hidden Characters: The three hidden characters are Balrog, the boxer and Juni and Juli, two prototype 'dolls' created by Bison's Shadowloo organization. Once the game's title screen has become the proper color (see 'Title Color Chart', above), their score listing will show up in the High Score listing and they become playable...

1) To choose Balrog, pause on Karin for five seconds, then move to any Random Select square, hold the Start button and press any button.

2) To use Juli, pause on Karin for five seconds, then move to any Random Select square. If the square is on the left side of the screen, choose her by holding Left and pressing any button. If the square is on the right side, then hold Right and press any button instead.

3) To use Juni, pause on Karin for five seconds, then move to any Random Select square. If the square is on the top of the screen, choose her by holding Up and pressing any button. If the square is on the bottom, then hold Down and press any button instead.


* Hidden Modes Of Play: There are three secret modes that affect basic gameplay. Once the game's title screen has become the proper color (see 'Title Color Chart', above), you can select a hidden mode to use...

1) To use Classical Mode, insert your coin, hold down HP+HK and press Start. You can release HP+HK once you're at the Player Select Screen. Then, pick your character. When you start the round your super power bar will be gone and you will have Street Fighter 2 moves.

2) To use Mazi Mode, insert your coin, hold down MP+MK and press Start. You can release HP+HK once you're at the Player Select Screen. Then, pick your character.

3) To use Saikyou Mode, insert your coin, hold down LP+LK and press Start. You can release HP+HK once you're at the Player Select Screen. Then, pick your character.


* Hidden Battle Mode: Once the game's title screen has become the proper color (see 'Title Color Chart', above), you can select a hidden battle mode...

1) Final battle mode: After picking your ISM, hold Start+LP+MK+HP. You'll fight Final Bison for one battle only. It's just like the last battle; win and you get your ending, lose and you get the bad ending.

2) Dramatic battle mode: Hold LK+MK+HK, then press Start. Keep holding those buttons at Player Select Screen for a moment. You'll fight a 2 on 1 battle for 6 rounds, in which you face two CPU-controlled opponents.

3) Survival mode: Insert your coin(s), hold LP+MP+HP and press Start. Keep holding those buttons at Player Select Screen. You'll get to fight all 27 characters in continuous one-round battles.


* Secret Messages (This trick only works on Japanese SFZ3 machines): After winning a battle, press and hold Start as well as any other button. Between battles, a message will appear on the screen, depending on the button you're holding.


* Sari In Every Stage: In Dhalsim's stage you may have noticed a girl who cheers for him. That is Sari, his wife. When you play as Dhalsim, its possible to make her appear on every fight by holding down LP+HK before the fight starts (You must do this at the begining of every round).


* Alternate Sodom BGM: When fighting against Sodom (VS o CPU, you'll get to hear a different tune if it is on X-ism mode. Apparently the tune is inspired on his boss tune in Final Fight.

- TRIVIA -


This game is known in Japan as "Strider Hiryu".


As Strider was made before the fall of Communism, one could take this as a 'cold war'-era game. The main plot of the story revolves around the fact that nuclear war had broken out and a Russian secret weapon went on a rampage, the only people being able to stop it are 'Earth's Final Guardians', the Striders. Hiryu is the youngest of the Striders. Kafazu (the setting of Strider) is yet another obfuscated name (think Gotham City and New York, for you Batman fans). It's actually Kazhakstan. If you don't know what that is, it's a country in central Asia. The number of mosques in Kafazu also reflects the fact that Kazhakstan is a mainly muslim population. Falchion is the name of Strider's sword.


This game runs on the Capcom Play System hardware (CPS).


One of the three girls at the end of level 2 appears as a striker character (Ton-Pooh) in "Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes".


Pony Canyon / Scitorn released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Strider Hiryu: G.S.M. Capcom 2 - D25B1001) on 21/05/1989.


- UPDATES -


On the title screen of the English language versions, Strider is written in English on top of the 'Hiryuu' Kanji. The 'Hiryuu' kanji are colored with a purple gradient.


In the Japanese version's title screen, Strider is written in katakana to the left of the 'Hiryuu' kanji. The 'Hiryuu' kanji starts out red, then catches on fire.


In the US version of Strider, Strider Hiryu is missing his yell when swinging his sword.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* To reach the ultimate bad guy without having to go through the entire enemy starship, you just play the LEFT player, and get yourself killed at the far LEFT end of the starship (the very beginning). When you reincarnate, you'll be at the far RIGHT end of the board, past the wall (or IN the wall if you weren't far enough left). The boss will not appear until you move to the left past where he should be (though things will start firing at you immediately). Kill the boss, get your free credit, start again. ;)


* Strategy Tip: Kill dreadnoughts with one timewarp and one cluster bomb. You always get the time warp back, plus other goodies.


* Score Hogging Tip: Clear out all the planets but one, and then fly around from starbase to starbase waiting for dreadnoughts to appear. Pick 'em off using the above method. This gets boring after a while, of course...

* Unlock Extra Maintenance: If you hold Test Button + PL1 Button 1 during boot, you get extra options in the test menu. A level skip, BG test usually etc...


* Sexy Pilots Images & Names: If you make a perfect score, you can see how the sexy pilots look and what are their names. In practice, this means getting three gold medals at the end of each stage (for time, accuracy and completion). This should be done in the first loop of the game, the pilot of the plane you chose will be seen at the end of this first loop. Two pilots will be seen if it's a two-player game. The pilots can also be seen in the Extra Maintenance menu.

$info=sundance,

Sundance (c) 10/1979 Cinematronics.


- TRIVIA -


The vector game PCB that Sundance ran on was the original Rosenthal design that "Space Wars" used, except there was a lot of cut-and-jumpering done to allow for the varying degrees of intensity that the vectors could show. Hence, the game was quite fragile and none of the machines lasted very long. Sundance had grids in space years before "Tempest". Skelly felt the game lacked the anxiety element needed in a good game and begged Cinematronics not to release it.


Cinematronics tried to make about 1000 of them, but the production fallout rate was around 50%. The problem was the 23" CRT which was manufactured by outside vendor. The carbon coating sprayed onto the inside of the tube was defective, and would shake loose and settle around the neck if the game was left in certain positions. When the game was powered up after shipping to the operators, the CRT would instantly burn up from arcing inside the tube. As a result, most Sundance suffered a quick death, and were likely destroyed or sent out to pasture in an operators back room.

Game ID: GX405


- TRIVIA -


This is the first basketball game presented by Konami.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Angle And Timing Rules...

Free Throws: 41-44 and 46-49% = 1 pt and 3 seconds, 45% = 2 pts and 5 seconds.

Jump Shots: Varies by location, 45% sinks from anywhere ('nice shot'), 5 seconds.

Dunk Shots: Same as above, grants one extra second.

Lose 5 seconds for each turnover, unless game clock is already at :09 or below.


* Speed and time are essential. The big points are scored on the after-game bonuses, and you need to score tons of points to beat the World Champs. Here's how:

1) The primary sweet spot on the floor is the baseline (right edge) on the right (bottom) side of the basket, anywhere inside 3 point range. You can win most games shooting only from here. Dribble there every chance you get and shoot while running out of bounds -- the computer can't block the shot and any reasonably angled shot will go in.

2) The secondary sweet spot is the bottom left corner of the free throw line. Periodically one of your players will post up in this spot -- a quick pass to him results in an easy shot if it's taken immediately. The computer can sometimes stop the play, but it's such a fast striking shot that it can pay off big when time is running low.

3) Basic strategy is score fast, score often, you need the time. Pass north-south, not east-west and you can get around the defenders to the baseline. Take most of your shots from there as outlined above, and you should score fast enough to beat most teams.


* Hint 1: On bonus shot screens, just shoot like crazy. You can have multiple balls onscreen at once, so don't bother aiming.


* Hint 2: After about the 4th team, you're better off just avoiding passing altogether as they pick off the balls too often.


* Hint 3: Move diagonally as much as possible rather than straight forward, and when under the hoop, you don't need to make a full jump to get it in easy - that just makes it easier to be blocked.


* Hint 4: If you're moving without the ball (say after a shot, to go rebound) it seems that you can run faster if you 'dribble' even though you don't have a ball to do that with.


* 5,000 Point Bonus: When you're shooting free throws, hold down the shoot button until the angle indicator is between 85 and 90 degrees. The ball will go straight up, bounce off the shooter's head, and bounce off the screen, awarding you a 5,000 point bonus.

When you talk about cameos in fighting games, this game is way packed in this category! Here are some famous ones...

Felicia: Can disguise herself as Megaman ("Megaman - The Power Battle"), Rikuo / Sasquatch / Huitzil ("Darkstalkers - The Night Warriors"), Gamof & Rimgal ("Star Gladiator - Episode:I Final Crusade").

Ibuki: Among her costumes are Rolento ("Street Fighter Alpha - Warriors' Dreams") and Chaka ("Jojo's Bizarre Adventure").

Chun Li: She disguises herself as Jun May Williams ("Star Gladiator - Episode:I Final Crusade") & Jill Valentine ("Resident Evil").

Akuma: He disguises himself as Leo ("Warzard").

Also when performing his Shun Goku Satsu the old way (Punch, Punch, Towards, Kick, Special) he parodies Guy's Musou Renge Super Combo! ("Street Fighter Alpha - Warriors' Dreams").

Lord Raptor's graveyard makes a cameo in Akuma's ending!

Ken: Some disguises are a soccer player ("Capcom Sports Club") and Hol Horse ("Jojo's Bizarre Adventure").

Tessa: In one of her costumes she disguises as Midler ("Jojo's Bizarre adventure").

Also when she is low on energy and she blocks an attack she summons Pao ("Warzard") and uses her as a living shield!. :(

Morrigan: When performing her 'Darkness Ilussion' she summons her kid sister Lillith ("Vampire Savior - The Lord Of Vampire").

Hauzer: The huge monster who appears on Ryu's ending is a boss character in "Warzard".

Zanglief: His Leaping Bite super combo actually happens to be a parody of Birdie's Murder Chain super combo (However Zangief modifies the second part of the move by biting the opponent instead of slamming them on the ground as Birdie does!).

The 'Capsy' soft drink (seen in Felicia's ending) is a parody of the Pepsi cola!. :)


Additionally you can find lots of famous Capcom characters on the game's backgrounds, some of these are:

Blanka, Dhalsim & his wife Sari, E. Honda, M. Bison, Cammy, Fei Long, Guile, Charlie, Vega, Dee Jay, Birdie, Gen, Sodom, Guy & Rolento ("Street Fighter" games).

Rikuo & Riki, Victor, Bishamon, Jon Talbain, Hsien Ko (disguised as Santa Claus!), Sasquatch, Demitri, Jedah (as a woman!), Donovan & Anita, Baby Bonnie Hood, Lin lin (in the game's logo!) & Huitzil (Darkstalkers/Vampire Savior games).

Chris Redfield (looking quite pale & angry!), the giant snake boss (that is trying to gobble up Rikuo!) & a few zombies! ("Resident Evil" games).

Helena ("Street Fighter III - New Generation").

Vampire Mistress in Red Dress (seen in Demitri's stage in "Vampire Savior - The Lord Of Vampire").

Demitri's girlfriends (seen in his own stage as well as in his ending in Darkstalkers & Nightwarriors games).

Jun May Williams & Rimgal ("Star Gladiator - Episode:I Final Crusade").

Don Tacos ("Pang! 3").

Pao & Leo ("Warzard").

Son Gokuu ("Son Son").


All of the death scenes that occur when a character is defeated are taken from famous old games, such as "Son Son"'s 'splash down the drain' or the famous "Final Fight" / "Double Dragon" 'blink-out'.


The long-nosed karate character bearing a halo that appears with Dan during certain moves is Dan's father who was killed by Sagat. The long-nosed karate fighter is a hilarious parody of Mr. Karate, aka Takuma Sakazaki of the AOF/KOF series, who wore a long-nosed Tengu mask in the original "Art of Fighting" when disguised as the final boss.

Super Missile Attack (c) 05/1981 General Computer.


- TRIVIA -


This game is an enhancement of "Missile Command".


GCC (General Computer Corporation) was founded in 1981 during the onset of the video game craze. C.E.O. Kevin Curran and MIT classmates Doug Macrae and John Tylko began by developing an enhancement for Atari's "Missile Command" and went on to create "Ms. Pac-Man", still one of the top-selling coin-operated video games in history. Between 1982 and 1984, GCC developed a total of 58 consumer electronics products that generated over $800 million in revenue for Atari and Bally Manufacturing.


- UPDATES -


The differences with "Missile Command" are:

* A new look to the game: different colors, different attract mode, etc.

* A new play to the game: more missiles, faster missiles and clouds that get smaller as the game goes on add challenge (and profit) to your Missile Command box. Plus a Totally New Attack Object, the 'UFO', which moves faster and more randomly than ordinary planes and satellites and fires a deadly new Laser weapon.

* A new sound to the game: each attack object now has its own brand-new sound that lets everyone know that this is no ordinary "Missile Command".

Not to be confused with the 1994 Super Famicom game of the same name, 'Super Punch-Out!!', which is a remake of the arcade game (certainly for the ten years anniversary).

Super Spacefortress Macross (c) 1992 Banpresto.


- TRIVIA -


This game is known in Japan as "Chou-zikuu Yousai Macross" (translates from Japanese as 'Super Space Fortress Macross').


Superdimensional Fortress Macross was created as a filler show. Studio Nue was building up to make a series called Superdimensional Cavalry Southern Cross, but they released Macross fisrt.  It proved to be their biggest hit, so popular that they extended it from 24 to 35 episodes. They followed up with Superdimensional Century Orguss, which didn't do quite as well, but was still popular enough to spawn a six OVA sequel (Orguss II) in the early 90s. Ironicly, Southern Cross did poorly and was cancelled after only 23 episodes.


Macross, however, has become a major anime staple. After the original series in 1982, there was a movie released in 1984 called 'Do You Remember Love?' This game is based on that movie. Later came a music special, 'Macross Flashback 2012', and then came 'Macross II' (see the history entry for "Super Spacefortress Macross II" for more details), 'Macross Plus' (1994, four OVAs and one movie), 'Macross 7' (1993, 49 TV episodes, 2 OVAs one movie), and 'Macross 7 Dynamite' (4 OVAs).


The Macross movie was written in such a way that somebody could understand it without having seen any of the TV series. As such, a lot of events had to be changed, often quite a bit. As such, Studio Nue considered it to be an alternate timeline from the original series. In the first episode of 'Macross 7', it is established the DYRL was a movie made within the official Macross continuity.


A number of leftover Valkyrie toys were later converted into Transformers toys on the Decepticon side (names?).

Super Spacefortress Macross II (c) 09/1993 Banpresto.


- TRIVIA -


This game is known in Japan as "Chou-zikuu Yousai Macross II" (translates from Japanese as 'Super Space Fortress Macross II').

The OVA series Macross II was created shortly after Japan's economic collapse in the early 90s. The amount of truely new material dropped off sharply, and sequels to old favorites that already had a built-in following were in vogue.  It was made without the input of the original creators, Shoji Kawamori and Studio Nue, and the resulting series was fairly dire.


The plug was going to be pulled after four episodes, but it sold well amongst anime fans in America (who were starved for Macross of ANY kind at the time), so the US anime company, US Renditions financed the creation of two more episodes. Macross II became the first work of anime to be financed by an American anime company. Fortunately, USR and their notoriously low-quality works are long-gone, the rights to most of their titles having gone to Manga Video, including Macross II. Macross II was officialy declared an alternate timeline by Studio Nue, who then made Macross Plus as an official sequel to Macross. Hopefully this knowledge will not affect your game enjoyment ^_^!

Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers (c) 09/1993 Capcom.

Game ID: CP-S II No. 01


Controlled with an 8-way joystick and six buttons.


- TRIVIA -


A special version of this game is known as "Super Street Fighter II - The Tournament Battle".


This game runs on the Capcom Play System II hardware (CPS II), this was the first game made for this system.


While New Challengers Cammy, Fei Long and T. Hawk were created by Japanese employees at Capcom, the Jamaican kickboxer DeeJay is the first and only Street Fighter to have been created by an American Capcom employee (James Goddard). Dee Jay's pant leg was originally going to have 'MANTIS' written on it instead of 'MAXIMUM'. It was changed so that when the sprite was flipped over (when Dee-Jay faces the opposite direction), the letters would not appear to be backwards. That is, all of the letters in 'MAXIMUM' look the same when flipped over, but the 'N' and 'S' in 'MANTIS' will be backwards when flipped.


Fei Long is Capcom's homage to Bruce Lee.


SSFII vs. MK2: both games were supposed to be released within weeks of each other (at this time, "Street Fighter" and "Mortal Kombat" were the dominant fighting games). Capcom released SSF2 early so that they could attract fans away from MK. At the same time, Midway released "Mortal Kombat II" early for similar reasons. As you can see, the result meant that both came back to square one. Originally all of the additional features that were added in "Super Street Fighter II X - Grand Master Challenge" (Gouki, Supers, etc) were planned for SSFII, but were left out due to time restraints.


Sony Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game on (Super Street Fighter II Arcade Game Track - SRCL-2822) 21/01/1994.


- UPDATES -


In Vega's ending in the US version, 'M. Bison' says something like 'Not even the 'Ancient One' dared to challenge me!'.

He doesn't say anything like this in the Japanese version.

He is also never referred to as an 'evil scum bag', as he is in the US version.


Fei-Long's ending is translated incorrectly into English.

Capcom USA added in a bunch of references to 'The Great One and his son' that were not originally there.

A summary of what actually happened in the Japanese version:

A director, impressed with what he just saw, approaches Fei-Long and wants him to star in his movie.

Fei-Long says: 'I thought you understood. What I want to do is not acting, it's real fighting'.

The director offers him as much money as he wants, but Fei-Long just jumps away.

Twenty years after Hong Kong's greatest action star has faded from the screen, three million students practice 'Hitenryuu Kung Fu' (translated from Japanese as 'Flying Heaven Style Kung Fu') in front of the originator's memorial statue.

Some are doing so today.

Their teacher's name is --- [Fei-Long never mentions 'The Great One and his son' (Bruce and Brandon Lee) and the director never says anything about 're-dizzy combos'. Fei-long is not among the students].


Cammy's ending is translated incorrectly into English.

In the Japanese version, Vega tells Cammy that she was a spy for his organization three years ago. Her teammates say that they don't care about her past; it's only important what she does from now on.

In the American version, 'Bison' tells Cammy that they were in love!


Some of the voice samples of Cammy and Dee Jay were changed from the Japanese version.


Japanese version quote - World/US version quote.

Cammy: 'Spiral Arrow', 'Cannon Drill'

Cammy: 'Cannon Spike', 'Thrust Kick"

Dee Jay: 'Slash', 'Max Out'


Here is a list of changes from previous SFII games:

* New title screen with new music.

* Completely new portraits for all of the characters. Vega's hat now has a winged-skull on it instead of a star.

* New endings for M. Bison, Balrog, Sagat and Vega. The last part of Chun-Li's ending is also modified, letting the player choose whether she should now live a normal girl's life or continue being a detective.

* Balrog no longer climbs the fence on his stage prior to doing his 'Flying Barcelona Attack' or 'Izuna Drop' moves. He now just jumps to the edge of the screen and jumps off, as he does in the other stages.

* Voice samples for characters and announcer re-recorded with different actors.

* USAF guys in Guile's stage are now wearing blue uniforms instead of green ones.

* The tugboat in Ken's stage is replaced with a yacht.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Super Secret Colors: Hold down the button you use to select your character for 3 seconds or so and you can get what is called the 'super' secret color (Note: You can't use the 1P or 2P start buttons to get the secret color).

Super Street Fighter II - The Tournament Battle (c) 10/1993 Capcom.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the Capcom Play System II hardware (CPS II).


If you have ever wondered why the characters in Super Street Fighter 2 have a ridiculous eight costume colours then now you will know. This version of SSF2 is quite rare but allows eight players to fight in a tournament. The reason for the eight costume colours is so all eight players can choose the same character and not get confused about which one they are.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Super Secret Colors: Hold down the button you use to select your character for 3 seconds or so and you can get what is called the 'super' secret color (Note: You can't use the 1P or 2P start buttons to get the secret color).

Super Street Fighter II Turbo (c) 02/1994 Capcom.

Game ID: CP-S II No. 03


- TRIVIA -


This game is known in Japan as "Super Street Fighter II X - Grand Master Challenge".


This game runs on the Capcom Play System II hardware (CPS II).


Originally all of the additional features (see Updates section) that were added in SSFII Turbo (Gouki, Supers, etc) were planned for "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers", but were left out due to time restraints.


Shin-Gouki, Shin-Gouki and Shin-Gouki: Depending on the kanji that's used for 'Shin', Akuma is of one of several personalities. As regular Akuma (considered to be an evil character by Capcom of America, but just an antihero by Capcom of Japan), he does not condone unnecessary roughness (he helps out those in need and only fights when either under self-defence or when challenged to a match - and any match is a deathmatch in his book). Shin-Akuma found in SFA2 is just regular Akuma not pulling his punches (it's the unnecessary roughness thing). Another note about Gouki: Akuma lives and trains on the island of Gokuentou, reportedly to have been destroyed in SFA2 (but Ryu was the only witness). Or, if you believe the non-canonical Pocket Fighter, turned into a tourist trap :-p


All of Gouki's voice samples are actually recycled voice samples from the other male characters.


Sony Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game on (Super Street Fighter II Arcade Game Track - SRCL-2822) 21/01/1994.


- UPDATES -


In the American version, all of Gouki's dialogue was removed instead of being translated. If you win with Gouki in SSF2 Turbo, Gouki has no victory quotes.


Some characters endings are translated inaccurately (See "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers" entrie for details).


Here is a list of changes from "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers":

* Modified title screen with new music.

* The 'Character Select' screen's background music is changed. The new song is based on the title screen theme of "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" (and the other pre-Super SF2 games).

* After each character's ending, a new piece of artwork is displayed for that character. In Ryu's new art, the kanji 'Fuurinkazan' <wind, forest, fire, mountain> are written on his belt. These are the same kanji that are displayed on the breakable signs in Ryu's stage in "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior".

* New artwork in Dhalsim's ending. The picture of Dhalsim and his son is replaced with a new picture of Dhalsim with his wife and son. The photograph on the wall now shows Dhalsim with Sagat and Vega (It used to show two generic guys).

* All bonus games have been removed.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Play As Akuma: At the character select screen, highlight Ryu and hold for 3 sec., highlight T. Hawk and hold for 3 sec., highlight Guile and hold for 3 sec., highlight Cammy and hold for 3 sec., highlight Ryu and hold for 3 sec., press all 3 punches and Start at the same time at the end of you counting.


* Akuma As Final Boss: If you reach the final stage on a single credit (no continues), you will fight Akuma instead of Vega.


* Super Secret Colors: Hold down the button you use to select your character for 3 seconds or so and you can get what is called the 'super' secret color (Note: You can't use the 1P or 2P start buttons to get the secret color).


* End Credits: If you beat the entire game without continuing, you will get to see the ending credits. If you don't lose a single round, the new ending artwork for each character is shown during the credits. Otherwise, you will see demos of the different characters fighting each other on various stages during the credits.

Super Tank (c) 1981 Video Games GMBH.


Super Tank is a shooter where you control a tank and have to clear a field of mines and bushes. You are chased by enemy tanks, which fire at you. After wiping out all the mines and bushes, you reach the second level. It is kind of a 'boss' level, where you have to fight a big enemy tank, the Super Tank. You can destroy it by a direct hit into its gun.


- TRIVIA -


Video Games GMBH (located in the town of Lich in Germany) started as an unauthorized bootleg manufacturer (i.e.: "Space Attack" (1978)). When the European countries changed their laws to protect the original creators, they started to develop their own arcade games. However, only two original games from Video Games GMBH are known to exist: Super Tank (1981) and "Looping" (1982).

Super Xevious (c) 1984 Namco.


- TRIVIA -


Super Xevious is not a sequel of "Xevious", this is an update!


This game runs on the "Galaga" hardware.


Namco released a boardgame based on this game (same name) in 1985 (in Japan only): Flying your ship about the levels (rolling the dice to move). Battle enemies on the ground by rolling dice, battle ones in the air via card combat. Build up your shields and power up your blaster as you progress through the levels. Each 'level' is a different board, and there's 7 levels (boards) in all. Cute little spaceships for your pieces.


- UPDATES -


The differences with "Xevious" are:

* Several new enemies are introduced, including a silver Galaxian flagship, two jet planes, a helicopter and a dark yellow tank.

* The Gameplay is a little more difficult.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Secret message: The designer of "Xevious" has included a trick for generating his name right at the beginning of the game. As soon as Solvalou appears, move to the far right edge of the screen and begin bombing constantly. Continue bombing until the first set of attacking rings is very close to you and then shoot the rings. The message 'Special thanks for you by game designer Evezoo.' will appear on the screen.

This is the first game officially sponsored by the Coca-Cola Company.

Note: Coca-Cola was invented in 05/1886 by a pharmacist, Dr. John S. Pemberton in Atlanta, Georgia. A bookkeeper, Frank M. Robinson, suggested the name 'Coca-Cola' to Dr. Pemberton. Robinson suggested this name because both the words Coca and Cola named 2 of the ingredients. Also the 2 'C's' would look good in advertising. The name 'Coca-Cola' first became a registered trademark in 1893.

Tac/Scan (c) 04/1982 Sega.


- TRIVIA -


Tac/Scan was the only Sega vector game to use a vertically mounted (portrait) monitor.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hint 1: The most effective strategy for extending your playing time in Tac/Scan is to add as many extra ships as possible to your reserve (listed in upper-left corner of screen). Ships must be caught by the leading ship position which is further signified by a red colored underline in order to be added to your reserve. To begin capturing ships you must have at least one open position in your fleet; otherwise the game will not award ships (kill off two of your ships on the edges of your fleet at the very beginning of the game to achieve the highest amount of reserve ships during the first wave).


* Hint 2: Wave one in Tac-Scan should always be played with a minimum of two ships in your fleet, with additional ships added as the levels get faster and harder. The second and third wave can almost always be effectively played with only two ships, and it is very important not to waste reserve ships in these two waves (saving those ships for the more dangerous first wave).


* Hint 3: Always keep changing directions on both wave 1 and 2. It is very effective to destroy ships while turning on wave 1, and on wave 2 ships will have a hard time hitting you if you don't stay in the same position for very long.


* Hint 4: The faster you fire, the shorter your shots will travel. Allowing a short pause between shots will allow them to travel the distance of the screen.

Tapper (budweiser) (c) 12/1983 Bally Midway.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the Bally Midway MCR 3 hardware.


There were two other versions of Tapper: Root Beer (01/1984) and Suntory (Japan, Game ID: 834-5385 / 834-5387).


The main character in the game (as well as the guy in "Domino Man" and one of the lumberjacks in "Timber") is based on a Marvin Glass employee named Mike Ferris who had the same mustache and bald head and wore a red T-shirt all the time. This game was play tested in a Chicago-area Rush Streetbar called the Snuggery with much positive feedback. Digitized belches were going to be used in the game, but they never made it into the final version.


The Tapper Suntory was a Sega board - Suntory is a Japanese beer.


- UPDATES -


Suntory version has different graphics and most likely different music.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Here's A Tapper Easter Egg: In the attract mode, wait until the word Tapper is filling up with beer, and hold down the joystick, both taps, and the player 1 & 2 buttons. You will then see the names of the game designers.


* Hint 1: Take your time in the first few levels. You can make a high score by leaving one person and waiting for more people.


* Hint 2: The last guy in the row will almost always leave a tip.


* Hint 3: If a person leaves the bar in the first level you get 50 points but, if you let them get close to the end of the bar, they will drink the beer and stay. It's 100 for getting the empty mug.


* Hint 4: The longer you stay in the level, the faster the people and mugs move.

Tattoo Assassins (c) 03/1995 Data East Pinball.


Nine Tattooed Assassins were ordered by Mullah Abba to defeat Koldan and his minions in this fun rip-off of "Mortal Kombat".


- TRIVIA -


This represents one of the most tragic tales in game design - one of the few examples of games to be dismissed by the programmers themselves. The idea started out simple enough - use Data East graphics hardware to produce a take-off of "Mortal Kombat". However, the hardware was not particularly up to the task, so the game needed gimmicks in the form of extra features etc. Bob Gale (producer of 'Back to The Future') came up with the story and concept, while it was up to Data East Pinball (Now Stern Pinball) to code the game. A preliminary test version was made, but already the programmers were getting depressed. Still there's nothing like a good show test to motivate programmers. They got nothing like a good show test - the game was heralded at that point as a disaster. At this stage all motivation departed, both programmers and artists were relying on each other to salvage the game. However, depsite recruiting the Data East animators to the job, most of the effort went into improving the video source for the digitised characters - Data East were apparently unaware that the original Mortal Kombat spent a long time in post production to correct video noise, which apparently was kept to a minimum by using cardboard costumes! As it was, Tattoo Assasins was never released for good reason. The 'official' reason for Tattoo Assassins being cancelled was that 'It did not compare favourably to "Killer Instinct"' - Rumour had it that the beta testers had to be supervised to ensure that they kept playing Tattoo instead of the latest pinball fixtures.


Echoing "Mortal Kombat II" and its intellectual fighters, Gretchen Stockdale (Hannah Hart) gave up modelling to become a fully qualified attorney.


Carlos and Daniel Pesina from Midway's MK series worked in TA. After that, Midway didn't want them to work with them in "Mortal Kombat 3", so they killed Johnny Cage (the only Daniel Pesina character that didn't wear a mask) and excluded Raiden (Carlos Pesina).


Note: The game claims there are 220 fatalities (see 'Tips And Tricks' section for more info).


TA is the only fighting game where you can kick while you block. And it's also the only fighting game where you see a man undressing to fart, and a woman farts too...

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Various Sewer Level Tricks:

1) When fighting in the sewer level, move your character as close as you can to the edge of the stone floor without falling to the water. If done correctly, no enemy in this level including the boss can touch you here as long as you remain on the floor's edge!

2) Stand just below the ledge in the middle of the screen. Then jump straight up. You will land just on the edge of the upper level. Nothing can hurt you for the rest of that level, but you can kill anything that comes close enough to you (You can't move up or down though, or you'll have to repeat this trick).

3) You can keep from getting hit by walking right along the edge of the brick floor. This prevents enemies from attacking you from multiple directions. You still need to nail enemies directly in front of you or behind you. This is easy with Donatello.


* You can theoretically get unlimited points. Use the yellow guy's boomerang. Lead one yellow guy in such a way that he gets stuck at an object (fire hydrant or barrel) between you and him, aligned horizontally. He will try to move toward you, but he won't be able to move since the object is near him. Get close enough to him so that he starts throwing boomerangs. You can kill each one for (wow!) 1 point.


* Killing most bosses consist of 3 strategies: They all consist of moving vertically towards the bosses.

1) Move vertically upwards, hit the boss, and move vertically downwards. Repeat until dead. Works well on Bebop.

2) Wait for the boss to move vertically down towards you, wait for him, hit him, and move vertically upwards. Repeat until he's dead. Works best on Rocksteady. Best results occur when you hit and run at the same time.

3) Wait for the boss to move vertically towards you. Jump over him, move through him and attack as you do this, keep moving. Repeat. Works well on the big robots.

* Secret music: After finishing a game, and provided you reach the top scores, you are given the chance to enter your name. Instead of writing your name, try one of the following:

1) Type the planner name: 'TOMI' (in this case 'TOM' will be displayed and the last letter 'I' acts like the END button) and you will be able to listen to the ending theme which only comes up after winning the final. This means, that if you win the final, you can listen to the winning theme TWICE! :)

2) Type the programmer name: 'MICH' (here 'MIC' will be displayed and the last letter 'H' acts like the END button) you will be able to listen to some other music which does not exist anywhere else in the game!

Tempest (c) 10/1981 Atari.

Game ID: 136002


- TRIVIA -


Tempest was an awesome arcade game that transported the player into abstract realms of space. Soaring into its second decade of life, Tempest is still the favorite of devotees who seek to become one with this adventure through hyperspace. Approximately 29,900 units were produced. Tempest sold approximately 20,000 units to distributors before it was even released.


Tempest was the first game to use 'Color-Quadrascan' and 'Skill-Step', both features unique to Atari vector games. Tempest was originally a 3-D "Space Invaders" clone called 'Vortex', but was changed when the other engineers didn't come back to play the game. This was kind of a test for an Atari game; if the engineers kept coming back to play a new game, it was considered a hit.


The first prototype of the game had the shape wireframe spinning and the gunner remaining stationary, but that caused motion sickness after a period of time so it was changed around.


* The Creation of Tempest: Dave Theurer, who designed the game and wrote the software, said his original intention was to make a first-person perspective of the "Space Invaders" game, but he ended up doing something completely new and different.  Rich Adam: "Dave implemented a first-person "Space Invaders". Everybody played it but they didn't keep coming back. You could tell when you had something cool, the engineers kept coming back. This was good and bad because there were times when you wanted to work on your game and everybody would want to be playing it. But when he was doing the first-person "Space Invaders", Dave didn't run into this problem of everyone wanting to play the game... and he said to himself: 'Well, maybe this isn't working. What can I do?' Then I came in one day and all of a sudden he had this round tube with these things coming up it. I said, 'What the heck is that Dave?' He said, 'I don't know. Aliens from the center of the Earth? I don't know.' I think he said something about having had a dream about it. I said, 'How does it work?' He said, 'I don't know. They're coming up around the edge of this thing and you're trying to blow them away.' He just sort of started out with this concept and took it from there. I can see why he would say that Tempest was certainly his proudest achievement. He worked extremely hard on that. It's pure creation from his own brain.".


* Remembrances from the Video Game Masters: Although known for his hard work and for his ability to focus on and conquer exceedingly tough software problems, Dave Theurer looks back upon his days at Atari as having been fun and rewarding. Dave Theurer: "It was just so exciting working on these new games. All my life I loved explosions. When I went to college I was a chemistry major because I wanted to do something where I could make explosions. When I was a kid I had a chemistry set and I'd blow stuff up all the time. Eventually, you learn that you can't really do that in real life, so the next best thing is to do it on the screen, so here I was blowing stuff up on the screen. Simulating real life is fun too. It's almost like you can create your own universe. Well, you are creating your own universe. That's rewarding, to see something come alive.".

Playing games, both video and pinball, was a constant part of life for the engineers at Atari. Dan Pliskin: "In the morning, I used to go in and I'd make up a pot of Italian roast or French roast coffee and pour myself a big mug. Then I'd go and sit it on a pinball machine and drink coffee and play pinball until scores got up to, like, a couple hundred thousand. That would be my indication that I was sharp enough to go and design something.".


* Popular from the Start: Tempest was a game that immediately captivated people from the very start. Lyle Rains: "Like a number of these games that were very addictive, the Tempest controls were good enough to where once you learned how to manipulate them you could almost become one with the machine. That is, a good Tempest player gets to spin that knob and do the firing in the right time and get into sync with the machine or get into a rhythm. I don't know exactly what to call it, but you were so close to the action that part of you entered the experience. You forgot about what was going on around you and you were just there. And you could get very good at it. I think what people like is the ability to accomplish amazing things."


* The Great 25-Cent Escape: Not only did players often find a sense of welcome escape in the video games they played, but this was very much the intention of some of the great game designers. Dave Theurer: "I want to design it for a guy who's totally frazzled by his job and needs a way to temporarily escape. There's a certain class of games... where you just get into a trance when you're playing them. As long as you're in this trance you'll do fine.".


A Tempest unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1983 movie 'Twilight Zone - The Movie', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1984 movie 'Night of the Comet', in the 1986 movie 'Running Scared', in the 1986 movie 'Maximum Overdrive' (A cocktail cabinet) and in the 1987 movie 'Death Wish 4 - The Crackdown'.


In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including: "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


These are cheats that were apparently left in by somebody at Atari. They were removed in ROM 217 and 222 software revision 2. First, you must complete level 8 and get a score with the format XXYYZZ: XX must be greater than 16, YY between 29 and 60, ZZ is a code listed below...

00 - freeze screen

01 - access bookkeeping totals

05 - allows playing during attract mode

06 - 40 free credits

11 - 40 free credits

12 - 40 free credits

14 - credit sound without actual credit

15 - credit sound without actual credit

16 - 40 free credits

17 - 40 free credits

18 - 40 free credits

41 - switch last 2 digits of score

42 - increase score quickly

46 - demonstration mode - start at any level, up to level 81

50 - player moves by itself

51 - player moves by itself

60 - objects drift down

66 - objects drift right

67 - objects jump

68 - objects drift up

70 - objects drift up


After code '05' (play during attract mode) is activated, the following cheats become available...

Set the last two digits to 46: Random-colored level with wrong enemies.

Set the last two digits to 48: 255 extra lives.

- TRIVIA -


Tetris is a CLASSIC; ranking with the likes of "Pac-Man", "Donkey Kong" and "Tempest"; and is still one of the most popular games today.


Inspired by a pentominoes game he had bought earlier, Alexey Pazhitnov creates Tetris on an Electronica 60 in June 1985 at the Moscow Academy of Science's Computer Center. It is ported to the IBM PC by Vadim Gerasimov and starts spreading around Moscow. Pazhitnov gets a small degree of fame for his program.


Here is the name of all tetrominos in Tetris (A tetromino is a geometric shape composed of four squares, connected orthogonally):

* The 'I' (Also called 'Stick' or 'Straight') - Four blocks in a straight line.

* The 'Square' (Also called 'O', 'Package' or 'Block') - Four blocks in a 2x2 square.

* The 'T' - A row of three blocks with one added below the center.

* The 'L' - A row of three blocks with one added below the left side.

* The 'J' (Also called 'Inverted L' or 'Gamma') - A row of three blocks with one added below the right side (This piece is a reflection of 'L' but cannot be rotated into 'L').

* The 'S' - Bent trimino with block placed on outside of clockwise side.

* The 'Z' (Also called 'Inverted S') - Bent trimino with block added on outside of anticlockwise side (This piece is a reflection of 'S' but cannot be rotated into 'S').


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


While on attract mode, if you pull player 1 joystick to the left and player 2 joystick to the right simultaneously the demo steps into its next phase. If you repeat it a few times the music will start playing...

Wonder 3 (the Japanese version) has some differences:

* The action game is called 'Roosters' instead 'Midnight Wanderers'.

* Roosters is slightly harder in a few ways: the stage 1 mid-boss has a faster rate of fire, the stage 1 end-boss is more aggressive by shooting less and punching more and near the end of stage 2 where the water is deep some of the platforms will crumble away when you step on them.

As odd as it may sound, this is one of the very few game that lets you use melee attacks with some firearms without actually firing a single shot, this allows you to use these only when you really need extra firepower! It is so strange that this idea is not used more often! :)

* 10,000 Points Bonus: At the start of the game, count your shots until arriving at the first railroad. If you've counted 40 shots, a little car should enter the screen on the right side. Destroy it with the 41th shot to get a 10,000 points bonus. There are similar cars throughout the game, but making them appear is a mystery.


* A Second 10,000 Points Bonus: Near the beginning there is a 'school house' with a red drum on the top. If you hit the red drum enough times, you'll get a 10,000 points bonus.


* Hint: Blast everything. Civilian cars and houses, etc, all give 50 points each.

The main character in the game (as well as the bartender in "Tapper" and the guy in "Domino Man") is based on a Marvin Glass employee named Mike Ferris who had the same mustache and bald head and wore a red T-shirt all the time. The original idea was to do a kind of two-player, simultaneous, competitive game. A beaver was originally programmed into the game to add some extra competition in cutting down trees but was removed.

Time Killers (c) 11/1992 Strata / Incredible Technologies.


Cartoony weapon-based fighter wrought with dismemberment and decapitation. Eight characters to choose from and cut apart!

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and five buttons.


- TRIVIA -


Time Killers was removed from many arcades for being just a little too gory.


This game had a unique button layout that no other games uses. Even its sequel, "Blood Storm", doesn't use it, but instead uses the "Mortal Kombat" five button X pattern. The unique part is those five buttons are laid out in a pattern that resembles the human anatomy on the Time Killer control panel. There are many moves that requires hitting all five buttons at the same time, which is easy to do with the above layout (use your entire hand to press all five buttons simultaneously).

A bootleg of this game is known as "Space Pilot".


Yoshiki was told to design a driving game. When he learned of the game's concept, he balked at making it and started on Time Pilot. As development continued, Okamoto showed his boss design docs for the driving game, all the while working on Time Pilot. Although his boss told him to do the driving game instead, he tried to take the credit for Time Pilot. Okamoto decided not to disgrace his boss and let the episode go!!


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* A Way To Get A Great Score: Finish the first stage as soon as possible. On the second stage, don't shoot anything!! Eventually, parachutes will start to appear. Collect the parachutes while avoiding the planes. Each parachute (after #4) will give you 5,000 points. It's possible to roll the machine over (999,999+ points) while remaining on level 2 using this strategy. By the way, while using this cheat you can also shoot the 1500 point bombers without causing the time bar to be shortened.

Time Pilot '84 - Further Into Unknown World (c) 06/1984 Konami.

Game ID: GX388


- TRIVIA -


A Time Pilot '84 unit appears in the 1986 movie 'Maximum Overdrive'.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* On the first level, head directly to the right. After a couple of screens, you'll see an unusual 'V' formation of silver ships that resemble craft in "Time Pilot", heading up or down. This easy-to-kill formation gives you 8,000 points, a good start to the game.


* The biplane from the original "Time Pilot" also makes a cameo appearance in TP84. To find it, fly right to the water and harbor area. Then turn vertically up the screen. When the biplane appears (over water), hit it with a missile, and you are rewarded with a free player!

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* A Way To Get A Great Score: In only a minute or so, there's a way you can rack up over a million points... On Class 1, after going towards the first gate, direct your innertube to the right side of the screen. A sign should say 'This Way to Class 2' and a whirlpool should appear next to it. Shoot the twigs in front of the entrance and paddle back up. You will now be at the start of Class 2. Right away, move to the right of the screen... the same sign will appear, only it'll warp you to Class 3. Shoot the iceberg in front, paddle back up and end up on class 3. The best part about the warps is that after each one, you get 600,000 points each! That's 1,200,000+ without barely doing anything! And you have 4 patches left in reserve thanks to your excess points!

- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the Williams / Midway Y Unit hardware.


Total Carnage is billed as the sequel to "Smash T.V.", mostly because of the dual-joystick controls and massive amounts of enemies onscreen. The concept of Total Carnage is a parody on the 1991 Gulf War. The main bad guy, General Akhboob, is a parody of Saddam Hussein. During scenes with him, he will say slogans from "Smash T.V." as well as things alluding to the Gulf War such as 'All we are making is baby milk!'.

Namco released a boardgame based on this game (same name) in 1985 (in Japan only): You move through each level of the dungeon to get a key. You roll a die for movement, take the shortest routwe towards the key, and after every roll (the game does not even have rooms or such), you have an encounter with a monster that you must fight. You get a treasure for each victory, and once you have the key, you can open the door that leads to the next level, and continue doing so on each level until you get to the 6th level where the princess is.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Begin by filling in the box in the lower left-hand corner. Once you've done that, fill in the two boxes (vertically) to its right, then the three to their right, and so on until you've effectively wrapped around the playfield and are back at the first box you filled in. Just repeat this motion until all of the boxes are full.


* Also remember that real points are to be gained not by filling in two boxes at once, but by punching out an enemy while the ambulance is still on-screen taking away another enemy. Doing this gives you 600 points as compared to the usual 300, or 150-200 for filling two boxes simultaneously.

Trog (c) 02/1991 Midway.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the Williams / Midway Y Unit hardware.


* PROTOTYPE REV 4.00: This particular code revison is also referred to in other resources as 'BattleTrog'. This prototype (known in Midway as Trog Proto 4) represents the original concept for the game Trog. The plans called for a strategy game where the player character, a dinosaur, had to be manipulated via placing bones to block his or her path, similar to many home computer games of the time. However, it soon became clear on field tests that players were confused and frustrated by this method of control in an arcade setting, where such strategic thinking was rarely required. Some surveys suggested that many players expected the game to be a simple "Pac-Man"-style affair. Many customers also were concerned/laughed openly at the action buttons labelled 'Bone', the term also being used in American slang for certain 'mature' acts and at least one cabinet panel was defaced to add an 'R' to the end of the word. As a consequence of this disasterous location test, the game was nearly axed entirely. Indeed, it probably would have been had it not been for the stop motion animation created for use as sprites in game - the story is that its high cost resulted in many of the senior employees at Midway demanding that Trog remain a going concern, with a new game mechanic built around the sprites. As it turned out, the game was turned into a "Ms. Pac-Man" clone, the small and large pills replaced with eggs and pineapples. It has been argued by some, including myself, that the use of trackballs instead of joysticks would salvage the original game mechanic, but closer inspection of the hardware through the MAME emulation suggests that 4-player trackball play, or indeed any trackball play could not be included without major complications, or indeed a whole new Midway hardware unit being devised.


* REV PA6-PAC: This prototype (known in Midway as Trog II Proto 6) represents the first major step towards the final Trog concept. The devitation from the standard naming system (the game would normally be listed as Trog PA6 only) represents the change in the project, the -PAc extension added to make it perfectly clear that this was a "Pac-Man" clone. With the original plans for a strategy game abandoned due to a poor location test, new thinking was required to salvage the project - it is rumoured that too much had been invested in the animation for the project to be canned at this stage. Money became very tight on the Trog II project (Trog I being the abandoned strategy game) and so a total rewrite of the concept was out of the question - they would have to make do with the existing code libraries for the project, with only minor alterations. Pushed for time and funding, the programmers decided to make the game into the Pacman clone many expected it to be, as this would require the least recoding, all that would be required would be to make the dinosaurs fully controllable, instead of the guided automatons they were originally. However, it was clear that the Trog AI would make them too good for even the best of players to overcome through clever moves, so a 'Punch' option was added which replaced the 'Bone' function and led to the only new animation added in the project, - a 3 frame jab which looked poor compared to that of the Trogs due to the time pressures on Haeger at the time of animation. But I digress... With this established, the programmers then altered the level order to provide a more suitable learning curve for the game, however this destroyed the main purpose of the 'Trog's Cave' intermissions screens and meant that the order of Trog's thoughts didn't fully match his actions. Also, although some of the 'thought balloon' animations (created on the fly through the game ROMS) were changed to remove the bone breaking scenes relating to proto 4, the cave drawings (done by professional 2D animators) could not be altered due to time and money considerations. The original ending of the game was also scrapped, as it was believed to be an anticlimax, so another hastily animated island was added for an extra challenge, purported to be Trog's Cave (Note the use of the intermission style lettering coupled with superimposed text straight from the ROM, again new graphics were out of the question). However, most of the other features remained intact, with a Complex Egg Lay option being added in the release versions to allow owners to change the egg patterns back from the Pacman style to the original layouts (it is believed that there may be a version of the game which put the original mechanic back in too, but no evidence of this has been found).


A Trog unit appears in the 1991 movie 'Terminator 2 - Judgment Day'.

* The bonus groove is still part of the released game's sound test, despite the fact it is now exclusively used for Trog's Cave and the ending - the prototype's bonus sequence was longer, as time and skill points were added, thus it needed music.

* The dinosaurs punch is poorly animated - this feature was added for the new game to allow fending off of the Trogs and as a result was just a few extra frames of animation made at the 11th hour by Jack E. Haeger.

* The last level uses the Intermission 'Trog's Cave' text, complete with graphical artifacts that were cut off on its normal background, due to the need to minimise adding graphics to the already overtime and overbudget project (the rest of the explanatory text is placed on screen using the same code that superimposes the victory messages).

* The Trog's Cave sequences no longer match up with the introduction of each new enemy - due to the restructure of the levels.

* Trog is seen trying to overcome bones in the recap drawings. In reality this scene was shot for the prototype, when the player's bones could be smashed or jumped on and not replaced due to the cost of redrawing the animation. (It is worth pointing out that the main scenes have bone bashing elements removed).

Tron (c) 05/1982 Bally Midway.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the Bally Midway MCR 2 hardware.


Walt Disney Productions charged Williams Electronics for copyright and patent infringement regarding Williams use of 'Tron' in "Robotron - 2084". Williams won the suit and Disney went on to hire Bally/Midway to create video games based on their movie.


Tron was originally slated to be a color vector game. It was designed using an early script of the movie. Basically, the team took various challenges Flynn had to go through and made them into four separate games-within-a-game. Three of the four scenes were either changed or removed from the final cut of the movie, but it still made one hell of an awesome game.


A Tron unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', in the 1986 movie 'The Color of Money' and in the 1987 movie 'Death Wish 4 - The Crackdown'.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* General Tips:

1) TANKS: hide behind corners and use them for cover when you shoot. Also, use the transporter in the center as cover. You can shoot clear through the transporter and out the other side and zap the computer. Don't use the transporter except for a desperation tactic. It will more than likely dump you right in the computer's gunsight(s).

2) SPIDERS: Fire in a constant spread and just hose 'em down from side to side. Gradually move in a constant arc up to the entrance. Stay just outside the entrance and hose the spiders above and below until time runs out. Enjoy the music.

3) MCP CONE: Move up so you're just underneath the rotating cone and on the right side. Shoot the blocks nearest to you. This gives you another shot more quickly than shooting blocks farther away. When you get a gap, move up and fire away due left. Above all, don't hang around and get caught : if the going gets tough, move on up and into the cone. Don't forget to twirl the knob as you rise. (You'll see if you do it)

4) LIGHT CYCLES: Use a question mark type shape for the first board. The Computer'll run right into it. For the harder boards, try to trap them either near the center tracks or against the wall. This is, by far, the hardest thing to do.

5) On the 3rd Light Cycle screen, travel at high speed up & then turn left JUST ABOVE the 3rd black grid line, then down when you reach the wall at which point you can slow down. All 3 cars will crash at virtually the same time.

6) On the 4th Light Cycle screen, simply turn left AT THE VERY BEGINNING at slow speed & all 3 cars will crash around you at virtually the same time.


* This is an interesting bug. On the MCP Cone levels, if you go all the way to the right or the left and keep moving, you can move the whole playfield to the side. This doesn't seem to have any other affect, but it is kinda fun to see.


* Here's an odd Tron bug: On the Recognizer Tank levels, make your way to one of the little alcoves in either the top right, or bottom left corners. The tanks cannot shoot, and will not go down an alcove, so therefore cannot kill you. Then, wait approximately 9 to 10 minutes without moving your tank. You can fire, but do not kill all the recognizers. After the time (9-10 mins), the sound system will go berzerk, starting with a very high pitch tone, which falls to a low tone that vibrates the cabinet. The sound also goes berzerk if you enter the tower at 0099 units on the bug screen.

Owen got the idea from the opening of the original 'Alien' movie during the landing sequence.


Originally called 'Tube Chase' as a vector game. Using the vector system from "Asteroids" and some software from "Night Driver", a prototype was created where you could fly down tunnels. However, He could not do hidden line removal, and all those lines got very confusing. A hardware engineer at Atari came up with an expensive hardware that drew ellipses. Owen re-wrote the game to use that. The game looked great. Multiple tunnels with splits and rotates. But it was too expensive. Then the hardware was changed to circles, but still too expensive. Then it was changed to rectangles. That was what finally shipped. But marketing felt just flying was not fun enough, so we added 'Star Wars'-like objects that flew down the tube at you and you had to shoot them. It was killed and brought back at least 3 or 4 times at Atari under the same name. It became 'Vertigo' when Exidy first took it, but they decided to pass on it when it did not test well at the arcades any more (at that time, it was only 3rd for 10 weeks!), and then finally 'Tunnel Hunt' at Centuri.

Difference between Twin Cobra and Kyukyoku Tiger:

* T.C. supports two simultaneous players.

* K.T. supports two players, but only one at a time. For this reason, it also supports Table Top cabinets.

* T.C. stores 3 characters for high scores.

* K.T. stores 6 characters for high scores.

* T.C. heros are Red and Blue for player 1 and 2 respectively.

* K.T. heros are grey for both players.

* T.C. dead remains of ground tanks are circular.

* K.T. dead remains of ground tanks always vary in shape.

* T.C. continues new hero and continued game at current position.

* K.T. continues new hero and continued game at predefined positions.

* After dying and your new hero appears, if you do not travel more than your helicopter length forward, you are penalised and moved back further when your next hero appears.

* K.T. Due to this difference in continue sequence, "Kyukyoku Tiger" is MUCH harder, challenging and nearly impossible to complete !

Ultimate Tennis (c) 1993 Art & Magic.


- TRIVIA -


Art and Magic were a group of coders and artists who had cut their teeth making various demos for the Amiga platform. Eventually they were approached by a hardware manufacturer, who wished to recruit them to make good quality games. Ultimate Tennis was their first, as they were still trying to adapt to their new platform, digitised sprites (all pallette swaps of the same footage) were used as a proof of concept - later the artists would develop their caracature style to make cel-animated sprites. Approximately 5,000 units were produced. 


Although their last official arcade game was released in 1998, the Art and Magic brand still continues making gambling games.

* Win Poses: By holding any attack button at the end of a fight, you may choose most of each character's win poses. However, there are a few that can't be seen with this trick, such as Felicia's perfect win pose.


* Tricks: Even though the Start button is mostly used as a taunt button, there are a few characters that can use it for some rather silly moves such as Sasquatch & Felicia.


If you leap at the enemy's head without attacking while using Felicia, you'll sit on their heads as long as neither player moves at all. An extra taunt? :)

Venture (c) 06/1981 Exidy.


Venture is a one- or two-player, color video game, full of surprising treasures. Venture is a series of games within the game. Venture is played in a dark dungeon of mutli-levels. The player forges through one level of rooms at the time, displayed on the screen as a floor plan. Armed with bow and arrow, the player learns to avoid confrontation with the wandering green Hall Monsters by skillfully entering the sanctity of a room. Once inside a room, the chamber's image grows to full screen size, creating a game within a game. Every room has a treasure or weapon guarded by a threatening creature or hazardous condition. The player must retrieve the treasure, avoiding threats and obstacles. When the treasure is succefully taken out of the chamber, bonus points are awarded. The screen image then returns to the original floor plan. Whenever a treasure is safely withdrawn, the player no longer has acces to that room. The player must win all the treasures of one level before descending to another level.

World's first video attraction to simulate a pinball game. Video Pinball was an instant winner. With fluorescent 'disco' 3-D playfield, challenging targets, bumpers, slingshots, rollovers and drop targets Atari Video Pinball had it all, but without all the mechanical objects associated with classic pinball games. Even a pinball "nudge" feature is included to give a more realistic feel to the play action. Approximately 1,500 units were produced.


A Video Pinball unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High'.

When you start the game, you'll see two elephants that the ship takes off from. On top of that they closely resemble Hindu drawings from India. The background for this game is based on a thousand's of years old book called the mahabarata that is regarded as a bible (sorta) for millions of Hindu's in India. When you read some of the verses in it you'll find funny descriptions of vehicles that the gods used that closely resemble modern aircraft of today. They are called Vimana's that carry *magical* axes and spears :). The mahabarata also describe what appears to be a technological war with missiles, nukes and huge flying fortresses and something which could be interpreted as radiation poisoning! The ancient Babylonian and Indian civilisations have often been an interesting pool for speculation and creative thinking regarding alien interference on earth in ancient times..

* Play As Dural: First, you must beat the computer Dural and have 2 games worth of credits in the machine ready to go. After beating the game, have one player press Start and pick a character. As soon as that character finishes smiling, but before the game actually starts, player 2 should press Start to interrupt the process. If your timing is perfect, and the stars are perfectly aligned, and you've been a good boy or girl, player 2 may come in as Dural.


* See Credits: You can get the credits of the programmers to come up on the screen by holding down a Start button during the demo. When it comes to the standard  demo w/ Sarah kicking Kage, the credits will come up. Keep holding the Start button to keep the credits coming or else they will freeze.


* Kage's Face Mask: It seems that after about 3,000 plays, the mask on Kage falls off instead of just his headband. You can see his teeth and a scar on his cheek.

Vs. Super Mario Bros. (c) 04/1986 Nintendo.


Classic and cult horizontal platform game featuring the Nintendo mascot Mario who must save princess Toadstool from Bowser.


- TRIVIA -


Basically, this is the arcade port of the Nintendo Famicom "Super Mario Bros." but see the 'Updates' section :).


- UPDATES -


There are slight differences between the arcade version Vs. Super Mario Bros. and the Playchoice-10 version of Super Mario Bros.:

* Item placement in the '?' and hidden blocks differs slightly, so if you're used to the Playchoice-10 version you may find a few different and unexpected items in certain familiar places.

* Parts of levels were also changed slightly, too, the most noticeable being a gap in the ceiling bricks on the way to the Warp Zone in World 1-2.

* This seems to make the World -1 trick impossible to do on Vs. Super Mario Bros., as it involved the use of these removed bricks.

* More enemies added in most levels

* Bug fixes / preventions.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Increase The Number Of Marios By 100 Or More: There is a way of increasing the number of Marios by more than 100. At the end of World 3-1, when Koopa Troopa comes on the block stairway just before the flagpole... and reaches the lowest step, jump on him to make him stop moving.


* The 999 Timer Bonus Trick: This one can be done on any of the -4 Worlds. It is most difficult to achieve on World 6-4 and World 7-4. What you do is try to end the level with the timer at 000, and the machine will act as though you have 1000 units of time instead of 0. It will drop to 999 and count down to 000 from there and award points for each unit of time. Simply jump to the axe as the timer goes from 002 to 001 and you should finish the screen with the timer at 000 and get the maximum bonus.

Wacko (c) 1982 Bally Midway.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the Bally Midway MCR 2 hardware.


The game originally had a wizard shooting at cute animals but Bally/Midway execs thought it was too cute and needed an edge. Monsters were designed by Scott and put in instead, plus Bally/Midway also called him at the last minute to replace the wizard with the little green alien from Kozmik Kooz'r. The slanted cabinet was an idea by Marvin Glass which required the trak-balls to be installed upside down to work properly.

Waga Seishun no Arcadia (c) 1982 Sigma Enterprises.


- TRIVIA -


The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Arcadia of My Youth'.


This game is known outside Japan as "New York New York".


Waga Seishun no Arcadia is based on the animated movie of the same name. The guy standing in the background of this game is Space Pirate Captain Harlock, the protagonist of the movie. Arcadia is the name of his ship. Starting before this movie and into the present day, Harlock is featured in a number of comic books, TV series and movies.


- UPDATES -


Differences between "Arcadia' and 'NY, NY':

* In the background of 'NY, NY' is the Statue of Liberty, surrounded by blue buildings.

* In 'Arcadia', the Statue has been replaced by Captain Harlock (who is still the same color as the Statue of Liberty for some reason) and there is a blue nebula instead of blue buildings.

* Also, the words 'New York' have been replaced by 'Arcadia' in the demo.

* Besides the picture of Harlock in the background, nothing else in the 'Arcadia' game really has any relationship with the movie at all.

* 'NY, NY' came first and was then slightly modified to cash in on the 'Arcadia' movie.

* There are also no additional copyright notices, as there would normally be in a game based on a movie (So perhaps it wasn't even officially licensed).

* Another odd thing is that in Arcadia it really doesn't make a lot of sense to have a giant cyan Capt. Harlock floating around in space in the background.

* Whereas in NY, NY it actually makes sense for the Statue of Liberty to be in the background.

Anime-style mahjong game with lovely female opponents and bonus games.

Controlled with a mahjong control panel.


- TRIVIA -


The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Young Grass Mahjong Story - Four Sisters'. 'Wakakusa Monogatari' is also the Japanese title of the Louisa May Alcott novel 'Little Women', of which this mahjong game is *very* loosely based upon.

Waku Waku 7 (c) 11/1996 Sunsoft.

Game ID: 0225


A hilarious parody of different styles of anime and video games featuring seven selectable characters and a nasty end boss! It's worth playing for the dialogue alone.

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and four buttons.


- TRIVIA -


'Waku Waku' is Japanese onomatopoiea for sounds of excitement.


This game runs on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware.


The bonus stage battle against Bonus Kun, the Shotokan punching bag, is a parody of Ryu and Ken of "Street Fighter" fame. Watch him imitate all of their best moves! It also appears that Bonus Kun's music stage is a parody of 'The Theme of Ryu', which is, as the name implies, the theme music for Ryu in "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior".


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Reverse Title: Accumulate 7 credits and the title will be reversed (77 too).


* Alternate Costume Colors: Press B, C, or D when selecting a fighter on the character selection screen.

War of the Worlds (c) 1981 Cinematronics.


- TRIVIA -


War of the Worlds (or WOTW for shorts) is based on the HG Wells science-fiction classic.


WOTW was one of the last vector games Cinematronics created. The game was never released due to it testing badly at the 1982 AMOA show. Less than 10 were made. They were all sold to distributors and sold at trade shows. The game did not generate enough interest to be put into production. One interesting note is that the game was originally made with the B+W X-Y monitors, but a couple years later, it was resurrected with a color monitor around the time of Solar Quest. Only one or two where made this way, and it is doubtful that they still exist.

Warzard (c) 1996 Capcom.


- TRIVIA -


This game is also known as "Red Earth".


Warzard is the first game to run on the Capcom Play System III hardware (CPS III), the first Capcom system that uses a CD-Rom instead of expensive EPROMs to hold the game data (about 50MB). When starting a cabinet with a new CPS-3 game the first time, the hardware needs 25 minutes to initialize the game. In fact it overwrites some flashroms with data from the new CD. This procedure allows the game later to startup as fast as it would normally run from regular EPROMs.

Wizard of Wor (c) 1980 Midway.


Players control a separate squadron of WORriors, the object is to descend into the many dungeons of WOR, killing monsters, beating the WIZARD and earning a high score. Full color video screen is accented by action sounds and haunting mood music. Dungeon maze patterns appear at random for a new play each time.

Controlled with a 4-way joystick and two buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the Bally Midway Astrocade hardware.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hint 1: When the warp doors open, use them as quickly as possible if the way is clear on the other side. This eliminates the possibility of one of the monsters appearing on top of you out of the blue by coming in from the other side. Otherwise, stay away from the warp doors if it's not clear.


* Hint 2: Try to make your shots 'short'. That is, NEVER start shooting down a long corridor! Your shots are limited, and the shorter the corridor, the more shots and the faster you can shoot.


* Hint 3: You already know this, but try to get used to using the radar - if you get good enough at it, you can almost use it exclusively when they monsters are invisible. It's not much use when you can see them, but it does help me when they are invisible.


* Hint 4: The Worluk almost always appears dead center in the maze. When you get down to one or two monsters left, try to situate yourself as strategically as possible, pointing to the center of the maze. He'll appear and you can bag him as he tries to move out into the maze.


* Hint 5: Try to make sure you use (and therefore close) the warp doors IF AT ALL POSSIBLE when the Worluk or Wizard appear. That keeps them in the maze a little while longer and if they don't escape through the warp doors, you get more chances at them.


* Hint 6: Don't ever try to get close to the Worluk - he'll nail you. You have a lag in control, due to the way the game is programmed, so don't ever assume you can turn around on an enemy before they simply walk right over you.

Wonder 3 (the Japanese version) has some differences:

* The action game is called 'Roosters' instead 'Midnight Wanderers'

* Roosters is slightly harder in a few ways: the stage 1 mid-boss has a faster rate of fire, the stage 1 end-boss is more aggressive by shooting less and punching more and near the end of stage 2 where the water is deep some of the platforms will crumble away when you step on them.

WWF - Wrestlemania (c) 08/1995 Midway.


Eight selectable wrestlers fights in mayhem with punishing head-to-head and team matchups and grueling WWF and Intercontinental title bouts.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the Midway Wolf Unit hardware.


The Midway coin-op has, within its code, the engine for a graphical reworking of Robotron, to be played like "Pong" in "Mortal Kombat II". However, the graphics were removed due to memory constraints, so the feature remains disabled.


In the crowd, you can see the people who made this game possible. If you look closely on the far right-top outside of the ring you'll see cracked floor below not moving 'Ed Boon'. On the far right outside of the ring you'll see 'Mark Turmell''s head on the TV screen. On the far left (and right) side outside of the ring 3 seats from the bottom you'll see secret guy with encrypted face eating some chips.


About fatalities: The original plan was for all 8 wrestlers to have finishing moves, but once the WWF got wind of it, they ordered Midway to not put anymore in.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Moves Names On: Tap Punch 4 times during vs. screen.


* No Blocking: Tap Block 3 times (both players) during vs. screen.


* Buddy Mode: Tap Block 5 times (both players) during vs. screen.


* Random Character: Press Up+Start at the fighter selection screen without moving the selection box from its original position.


* Alternate costume Colors: While holding left (for fighters on left side) or right (for fighters on right side) press P, K, PP or PK when selecting a fighter.


* Mortal Kombat 3 Code: Win 25 fights to get MK3 Unlimited run code.


* Fatalities: To perform a fatality, you must win the match, then do the proper joystick/button sequence when 'Pin Him' appears.

Undertaker: Up, Down(x2), Punch (opponent must be in mid-left of the ring).

WWF Superstars (c) 07/1989 Technos.

Game ID: TA-0024


Basic tag team wrestle game with 6 superstars of the moment.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* There's a mildly amusing glitch in WWF Superstars involving Randy Savage. Use him & then pick anyone else and play until you face Andre and DiBiase.

1) With Savage as your active wrestler and Andre as the legal man, climb in and out of the bottom of the ring until Andre decides to climb out after you. When you begin to see those first few animation frames of his lumbering descent, quickly walk backwards to the left side of the screen.

2) Dash at Andre so that the instant his final animation frame has him standing on the ring floor you'll have connected with a flying clothesline. For a second, you will have 'pulled' an additional Andre out of the standing Andre's body with that flying clothesline! The standing Andre vanishes once the clothesline has taken its course and the prostrate Andre then becomes the active sprite.

X-Men vs. Street Fighter (c) 09/1996 Capcom.

Game ID: CP-S II No. 20


The first 'Capcom vs.' fighter, featuring 16 classic characters and fast-paced tag action. The mighty Apocalypse is reduced to but a punching bag!

Controlled with an 8-way joystick and six buttons.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the Capcom Play System II hardware (CPS II).


Victor Entertainment released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (X-Men Vs. Street Fighter - VICL-2176) on 21/11/1996.


- UPDATES -


Akuma is called Gouki in the Japanese version. Akuma means 'devil'. Gouki means 'powerful oni' (An oni is a Japanese mythological creature, kind of like an ogre or demon).


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Play As Akuma: At the character select screen, highlight Magneto or Juggernaut or Dhalsim and press Up.


* Play As Alpha Chun Li: At the character select screen, highlight Chun Li, hold the Start button and press any action button.


* Play As the Same Character: Enter the random selection code and if you can make it stop on the highlighted character, the highlight will remain there, enabling you to select the same character twice. This does some strange things to the life bars, so be careful. It may also screw up the palette for one of the characters on the selection grid, but this will not effect game play.


* Alternate Costume Colors: Highlight a character at the character selection screen then press a Punch button for a darker costume or Kick for a lighter costume.


* Random Fighter: Highlight any fighter on the left or right edge of the character selection screen, then hold the Joystick away from the center of the screen.

Note: You can also fight against the same character by getting the random selection to stop on the originally highlighted fighter.


* Continue Attacking: Press Start immediately after winning the match to continue hitting the defeated character.

The word 'Xenophobe' (pronounced 'Zee-no-phobe') is a psychiatric term meaning 'fear of aliens'.


This game runs on the Bally Midway MCR 68k hardware.


Xenophobe was a highly original game with a highly original concept. It was the first split-screen game. It was also a victim of a production scheduling snafu. Due to its production being pushed ahead, a lot of the game's tuning was axed. There are many objects in the game that the player can pick up, but have no use.

The gigantic flying fort was officially named 'Andor Genesis'.


In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including: "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".


- UPDATES -


The high-score name are 3 characters long on the version licensed to Atari. It's 10 characters long on the version manufactured by Namco.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Secret Message: The designer of Xevious has included a trick for generating his name right at the beginning of the game. As soon as Solvalou appears, move to the far right edge of the screen and begin bombing constantly. Continue bombing until the first set of attacking rings is very close to you and then shoot the rings. The message 'Namco ORIGINAL Program by EVEZOO' will appear on the screen.


* Free ship: When the gray 'walls' start spinning toward you, wait until you see the large gray house in the mid-left part of the screen. Immediately fly to the left-most part of the screen and wait for your bomb sight to start blinking, then bomb away! A tower will grow from the sand. Bomb it and you get a free ship.


* Hidden cities: There are many hidden cities called 'Sol Citadels', which fire rockets at you when bombed. You get 2000 points for bombing the cities and once the rockets appear, they can be bombed again for an extra 2000 points. Your bombsight will always alert you when you move over one. To find them, sweep over seemingly innocuous areas of green field, sandy desert and strips of grey - your sights should soon pick them out. The first one is quite early on (about 30 seconds into the game or so), in the right-hand corner of a field before you move over trees and into the first lot of ground-based targets. Another can be found just after a horizontal road that runs the whole length of the screen, dead center in the green strip. Also check to the right of the moving target on the pier after flying over the ocean for the first time. A definite one is after the first set of tumbling walls, above and to the left of the large grey pyramid. One can be found in the run-up to the first mother ship - when tackling the ground targets, look where the two vertical roads are joined by a thinner horizontal strip - one is hidden in the top-left crook. Four are located in a diagonal line before the second mother ship and after you pass over the bird in the desert the second time there are 8 in two long rows of 4!!


* Special flags: There are several Special flags that give you an extra ship (plus a 1,000 point bonus). The Specials are not detected by your sights. The first Special is in the first cross screen river after three tanks that don't move. It's usually in the lower part of the river on the far left or far right. Its position moves around so you need to bomb the whole river. During the first set of tumbling walls, you'll pass over a half-desert, half-forest area. Look for a small lake shaped like a kidney with a thin stream running to the right - bomb in a straight line across the stream repeatedly (including into the lake) and you'll find one Special. Fly over it to pick it up for a bonus ship. The third Special (there are four overall) is somewhere in a horizontal line at the tail of the first full bird in the desert. You'll fly over one partial bird and then later pass over one full bird. Start bombing in a horizontal line along the bottom of the full bird's tail.

* Others:

VFD handheld game (1981) released by Coleco: One of the coolest handheld arcade conversion, Coleco's Zaxxon uses a unique combination of mirrors and 2 different VFD displays to get a 3-D affect. Your ship appears to flying above the service of the planet and actually flies over walls and other VFD generated images (not possible with just one VFD display). The planet's serfice and ground based enemies are created by one VFD, while you and air-based enemies are created by the VFD reflected off a mirror.

LCD handheld game (1982) released by Bandai: It's a cool double panel LCD game (there are two LCD panels on top of each other). The dual panel creates a kind of 3D effect with lower objects on one panel, and higher ones on the other. Also, all of the background images are created by the LCD and animated. It's quite impressive for an LCD game (and a must have if you love Zaxxon!).

VFD handheld game (19??) released by Bandai: This game has a unique way of creating a 3-D effect - it only uses 1 VFD display (unlike Coleco's Zaxxon which uses two). The VFD is basically split in two, the upper half you see as the lower part of the playing field, while the lower part of the VFD is reflected on a semi-transparent mirro to create the upper half of the 3-D playing space. Pretty cool idea to help, and it really works in that all of the ships (not just the players ship like on the Coleco version) have a true depth. It's a little awkward to play sometimes as you have to sit just right to get all the of screen centered perfectly, but once you are in position, it's a very nice version of Zaxxon. It features the planes in space mode, and the flying over land mode. The only that seems to missing is the actualy Zaxxon boss at the end...

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Crystal Codes:

Level 2 - The Crystal Code is posted at the end of the level, on the 2 pillars framing the wrought iron gate (below the head with the horns).

Level 3 - The Red Crystal is obtained at the end of the level in the elevator.

Level 4 - The Blue Crystal is hidden in a statuette on a pillar (the statuette resembles the level 2 famous head with the horns).

Level 5 - The Green Crystal is obtained at the end of the level by killing the 2-heads monster.


To fight the final boss, the Crystal Codes seen on level 2 should be inserted: Red, Green, Blue - if not it is assured death.

Zoo Keeper (c) 1982 Taito.

Game ID: ZA


You control Zeke the zookeeper who must rescue his girlfriend Zelda from the Zoo.

Controlled with a 4-way joystick and one button.


- TRIVIA -


This game runs on the "Qix" hardware.


Originally called 'King Crab', Zoo Keeper was one of the few American-designed games that Taito released (with "Space Dungeon" and "Qix" being two others).


The game went out in 1983 and was about the number three game of the year nationwide, which was quite good. Unfortunately, this was right at the time when the whole arcade market took one huge dive, so the game only sold a fraction of what it would have if completed just a year earlier.


Zoo Keeper contains a little-known free game feature. You can go into option and set the 'Free Game Rate' to 99 to make it appear more frequently. If it's set to 0, it won't come out at all. The Zoo Keeper Flyer actually has a note saying that the free game feature maybe prohibited in some states! - The free game icon pops up on one of the platforms on the 3rd screen (coconuts). It comes out like one of the bonuses, but instead it says 'Free Game' in a little box. When it appears, it has it's own little tune too (and it usually pops up opposite of where you are, so if you are at the bottom of the screen, it will come out at the top).


- UPDATES -


Early machines had a bug in which the player could turn the machine off and on and get one or two free credits.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Use A Benefit Free Try: Start the game, build the first wall of bricks a bit without jumping and immediately crash into an animal. If you have never jumped before, you won't lose a life. The game will simply advise you that you need to jump over animals to avoid them and round 1 will start again from its beginning. Best of all, you get to keep the wall of bricks that you built a bit.


* An Obscure Trick: On the coconut boards, when you jump onto the top ledge, you get some points. Jump off the ledge then onto it again; you'll get twice as many points. And again, for four times as many. The bonus keeps doubling until 300K per land. The best board to try this on is the board where the ledges are invisible. It's kind of hard to jump on then off, but so few coconuts are thrown that you have lots of room for error.
